27373,Naik,Jadunath Singh,1 RAJPUT (4 GUARDS),"Naik Jadunath Singh was born on 21 November 1916 in Khajuri village of Shahjahanpur district
in Uttar Pradesh. He came from a humble background. His father Mr. Bir Bal Singh Rathore was
a farmer and his mother Mrs. Jamuna Kanwar was a homemaker. Naik Jadunath Singh was one
of the eight siblings- seven boys and a girl. He did not have access to good school education and
till class 4, he attended the village school, simultaneously working in the fields or at home to
contribute to the family income. He was known in his village as a wrestling champion who would
often take on the rogue elements of the village. 1Naik Jadunath Singh was enrolled in the Rajput
Regiment on 21 November 1941 at the Rajput Regimental Centre, Fatehgarh. After completing
his training, he joined 1 RAJPUTS and then took part in World War II, proving his mettle even
then. After about six years of service, he was promoted to the rank of Lance Naik in July 1947. In
Dec 1947, Naik Jadunath Singh’s battalion, 1 RAJPUT was deployed in J&K to take part in the
ongoing war with Pakistan after it had attacked Kashmir in Oct 1947.2

2 IbidThe Rajput Regiment is one of the oldest infantry regiments of the Indian Army, tracing its origins
to 1778 with the raising of the 24th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry. The 1st battalion of the
regiment was formed in 1798. After World War I, the Indian Army was restructured and most
Rajput regiments became battalions of the 7th Rajput Regiment. These included the 2nd Queen
Victoria's Own, 4th Prince Albert Victor's, 7th (Duke of Connaught's Own), and 11th Rajputs.
Before India gained independence from the British Empire, the regiment consisted of Rajputs and
Punjabi Muslims. The regimental insignia is a pair of crossed Rajputi Katars flanked by three
Ashoka leaves on either side. This is mounted by the Lion Capital of Ashoka and a scroll below
with the words ""The Rajput Regiment"". The regimental motto of Rajput Regiment is ‘Sarvatra
Vijaya’ meaning ‘Victory everywhere’. 1 RAJPUT was later redesignated as 4 GUARDS.
The Brigade of The Guards is a regiment of the Indian Army. The troops from all parts of the
country serve together in various battalions of this regiment. The Brigade of the Guards was raised
to implement government’s policy of encouraging army recruitment from regions which had been
under-represented in the forces. Three of army's oldest battalions - 2 PUNJAB, 1 GRENADIERS,
and 1 RAJ RIF were converted as the GUARDS battalions in 1949. In 1950 1 RAJPUT was
converted to 4 GUARDS. During the first war of Kashmir 1 RAJPUT (4 GUARDS) showed their
mettle in the battle of Taindhar, where Naik Jadunath Singh fought valiantly and won the first
Param Vir Chakra for his regiment.3
The first Indo-Pak war fought between the independent countries of India and Pakistan began in
1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan were the attempts by Pakistan to annex
the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. On the map of India, the state of Jammu
and Kashmir appeared as a somewhat rectangular projection in the extreme North-West corner of
the sub-continent. In size it was the largest of the Indian ‘Princely States’ during the pre-
independence era. It was 222,870 sq km or roughly double the area of Demark, the Netherlands,
Belgium and Luxemburg combined. The state was important because of its strategic location. Even
before the birth of Pakistan, Jammu and Kashmir was surrounded on almost three sides by foreign
states. Today, its importance has been accentuated by recent international developments. To the
East lay Tibet; to its North lies Chinese Turkestan or Sinkiang (Xinjiang); to West is Afghanistan;
to South-West and South was Pakistan; and to the South and South-East lay the states of Punjab
and Himachal Pradesh of India.4 The narrow Wakhan corridor, a narrow strip of territory in
Afghanistan, extending to China and separating Tajikistan from Gilgit-Baltistan, was to the North

Government of IndiaWest. Some of the significant battles that took place in Jammu and Kashmir were, the Battle of
Badgam, capture and recapture of Jhangar, battle of Naushera, the advance to Tithawal, the relief
in Punch and the fight of Chhamb to Tithwal.
On 01 February 1948, 50 (Independent) PARA Brigade launched an attack at night and captured
Naushera by the morning of 02 February. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and withdrew from
their position. Enraged at this reverse, Pakistan launched a massive attack from different directions
on 06 February 1948 with 15000 raiders to recapture Naushera and a grim battle ensued. Taindhar,
a hill feature immediately overlooking Naushera received particular attention where repeated
attacks were launched by the enemy. 1 RAJPUT held the feature and inflicted heavy casualties on
the enemy. It was here that several gallant actions took place including hard hand-hand fighting.
On 06 February 1948, stung and mortified at the loss of Kot, the enemy launched an all -out attack
on Naushera. The picquets at Taindhar received the brunt of attack by 3000 Pathans of Swat and
Dir, using mortars, machine-guns, and grenades. The enemy under cover of darkness had crept
upto the Indian picquets and defensive locations on commanding features. At first light, the men
in picquets and posts saw thousands of armed men creeping into the Indian territory. At Picquet
No 2 in Taindhar, Naik Jadunath Singh was in command of a forwardsection post, which bore the
full brunt of the enemy attack. This post was held by nine men and faced overwhelming odds. The
enemy launched its attack in successive waves and with great ferocity to capture this post. The
first wave swept up to the post in a furious attack. Displaying great valour and superb qualities of
leadership, Naik Jadunath Singh skillfully used the small force at his disposal so that the enemy
retired in utter confusion. Naik Jadunath Singh then reorganised the soldiers under him in
preparation for facing another onslaught despite the fact that four of his men had been injured.5
His composure and bravery inspired the men to rally together and prepare for the second attack,
which arrived more resolutely and, in larger numbers, than the first. Despite being vastly
outnumbered, this post withstood under the valiant leadership of Naik Jadunath Singh. Inspite
having a right arm injury, he personally seized the Bren gun from the injured Bren Gunner in view
of the fact that everyone else had been injured. The enemy came right up to the forward defences,
but Naik Jadunath Singh once again displayed extraordinary skill and valour in battle.

India.He inspired his men to fight by showing utter disregard for his own safety and by setting an
excellent example of calmness and courage. His fire was so accurate that it converted what
appeared to be an oncoming defeat into a win, and the enemy fled in confusion, leaving their dead
and wounded across the land. Naik Jadunath Singh protected the post from a second attack with
this act of extraordinary bravery, setting a high standard for leadership, and demonstrating his
tenacity. All of the post's soldiers had suffered injuries and losses by this time. The enemy launched
his third and final assault in full force, determined to capture this post. Now wounded, Naik
Jadunath Singh prepared himself to engage in combat for a third time.

He emerged from the sanghar shooting his sten gun with tremendous bravery and determination.
He launched a single-handed attack on the approaching opponent, who was completely caught off
guard and fled in confusion. However, Naik Jadunath Singh met a valiant end during the third and
final assault when he was struck by two bullets in the head and chest. In doing so, this non-
commissioned officer displayed the highest level of valour and self-sacrifice, preventing his
section—indeed, his entire picquet—from being overwhelmed by the enemy at the most crucial
moment of the war for Naushera's defence. The victory of Naushera on 06 February 1948, paved
way for the recapture of Jhangar.
He inspired his men to fight by displaying utter disregard for his own safety and by setting a good
example of calmness and courage. The story of Naik Jadhunath Singh’s sacrifice and bravery
remains till date one of the most highly regarded stories of bravery in the glorious history of Indian
Army. For his undiminishing courage and undeterred determination, he was awarded Param Vir
Chakra.","27373 Naik Jadunath Singh 1 Bn. The Rajput Regiment (Posthumous) (6-2-48)
At No 2 picquet on Taindhar on 6 February 1948, No. 27373 Naik Jadunath Singh was in command
of a forward section post, which bore the full brunt of the enemy attack. This little post was
garrisoned by nine men against overwhelming odds. The enemy launched his attack in successive
waves and with great ferocity to overcome this post. The first wave swept up to the post in a furious
attack. Displaying great valour and superb qualities of leadership, Naik Jadunath Singh so used
the small force at his disposal that the enemy retired in utter confusion.
Four of his men were wounded but Naik Jadunath Singh again showed his qualities of good
leadership by reorganizing the battered force under him, for meeting another onslaught. His
coolness and courage were of such an order that the men rallied and were ready for the second
attack, which came with greater determination, and in larger numbers than the preceding one.
Though hopelessly outnumbered, this post, under the gallant leadership of Jadunath Singh resisted.
All were wounded, and Naik Jadunath Singh, though wounded in the right arm, personally took
over the Bren-gun from the wounded brengunner. The enemy was right on the walls of the post,
but Nk Jadunath Singh once again showed outstanding ability and valour of the highest order in
action. By his complete disregard for his personal safety, and example of coolness and courage,
he encouraged his men to fight. His fire was so devastating, that what looked like impending defeat
was turned into a victory and the enemy retreated in chaos leaving the dead and wounded littered
on the ground. With this act of supreme heroism and outstanding example of leadership and
determination, Naik Jadunath Singh saved the post from the second assault.
By this time, all men of the post were casualties. The enemy put in his third and final attack in
undiminished numbers and determined to capture this post. Naik Jadunath Singh, now wounded,
prepared literally single-handed to give battle for the third time. With great courage and
determination, he came out of the sanghar firing his Sten gun. He made a most magnificent single-
handed charge on the advancing enemy, who was completely taken by surprise and fled in disorder.
Naik Jadunath Singh, however, met his gallant death in his third and last charge when two bullets
hit him in the head and chest. Thus, charging single-handedly at the advancing enemy, this Non-
Commissioned Officer, performed the highest act of gallantry and self-sacrifice and by so doing
saved his section-nay his whole picquet-from being overrun by the enemy at the most critical stage
in the battle for the defence of Naushera.

IC-521,Major,Somnath Sharma,4 KUMAON,"Major Somnath Sharma was born on 31 January 1923 at Dadh, Kangra, then in the Punjab Province
of British India (now, Himachal Pradesh). His father, Major General Amar Nath Sharma, was also
a military officer and retired as Director, Army Medical Services as were his brothers Lieutenant
General Surindar Nath Sharma (who retired as Engineer-in-chief) and General Vishwa Nath
Sharma (who was the Chief of Army Staff, 1988–1990), and his sister Major Kamla Tewari was
an Army Doctor. Major Sharma’s family had a long tradition of military service – his uncle,
Captain K D Vasudeva, had died defending a bridge on the River Slim against the Japanese during
the Malayan Campaign in World War II. Vasudeva’s gallantry had made it possible for hundreds
of his jawans to cross over to safety, a fact that greatly influenced Major Sharma throughout his
career. He attended Sherwood College in Nainital before joining the Prince of Wales Royal
Military College in Dehra Dun and subsequently joining the Royal Military College at Sandhurst.
On 22 February 1942, he received his commission into the 8th Battalion, 19th Hyderabad
Regiment (later, 4 KUMAON). During his early career, he served under Colonel K S Thimmayya
(the only Indian to command an Infantry brigade in battle during the World War II and Chief of
the Army Staff, 1957–1961) during the Arakan Operations in Burma. For meritorious action in the
face of the enemy, Somnath Sharma was awarded a ‘Mention-in-Despatches’. He was awarded
Param Vir Chakra for display of exceptional valour and conspicuous courage during the Indo-Pak
war of 194-48. His actions made him the first recipient Param Vir Chakra.1

1 A hero for generations of soldiers : Major Somnath Sharma (Accessed on 20 October 2022)
https://www.aviation-defence-universe.com/a-hero-for-generations-of-soldiers/The Kumaon Regiment traces its origins to the 18th century and has fought in every major
campaign of the British Indian Army and the Indian Army, including the two world wars. During
World War I, a Kumaon battalion was raised at Ranikhet on 23 October 1917 as 34/39th Kumaon
Rifles. In 1918, it was redesigned as 1st battalion, 50th Kumaon Rifles and a second battalion was
raised. These were merged with Hyderabad contingent into the 19th Hyderabad Regiment in 1923.
On 27 October 1945, the 19th Hyderabad was renamed as 19 Kumaon Regiment. Post-
Independence, it is known as the Kumaon Regiment. Staying true to the regimental motto of
Parakramo Vijayate (Valour Triumphs) the regiment has proved its mettle in Indo-Pak war of
1947-48, Sino-India War of 1962, Indo-Pak war 1971, Kargil War of 1999 and had been a part of
India’s Peace-keeping force in Sri Lanka. During the first war of Kashmir, 4 KUMAON displayed
exceptional combat skills in the battle of Badgam2.
The first Indo-Pak war fought between the independent countries of India and Pakistan began in
1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan were the attempts by Pakistan to annex

While elements of 161 Infantry Brigade were sent out to guard the various approaches to Srinagar,
the reports were being received that the raiders were infiltrating towards Srinagar from different
routes and one of the columns was heading for Badgam, a village about eight miles South-East of
Srinagar. The village was less than two miles from the airfields. An enemy force lodged there
could easily threaten it. 4
At that time, Major Sharma’s left hand was in a plaster cast due to a fracture he had suffered while
playing hockey. Though he was advised rest due to his injury, he insisted on being with his
company in the battlefield and was given permission to command his sub unit. Their mission was
simple – hold the valley of Kashmir, repel all invaders, defend the newly independent state of
India. His company was airlifted to Srinagar on October 31, 1947.
4 Param Vir: Our Heroes In Battle. Maj Gen Ian Cardozo. (2003). The Lotus Collection, Roli Books Pvt. Ltd. New Delhi,
India.On 03 November, three companies of 4 KUMAON were deployed in the Badgam area on patrol
duties. Major Somnath Sharma's company was ordered to go on a fighting patrol to Badgam in the
Kashmir Valley. He arrived at his destination by the first light and took up position about 1100
hours south of Badgam. It was at 1430 hours in the afternoon when a 500-strong force of tribal
lashkars (raiders), supported by mortars, attacked the 50 Indian jawans of Major Sharma’s
company. Surrounded by the enemy from three sides, 4 KUMAON began sustaining heavy
casualties from the ensuing mortar bombardment. Outnumbered by 10 to 1 he immediately sent a
request to Brigadier LP ‘Bogey’ Sen for reinforcements.
The enemy, attacked the position from three sides, resulting in significant casualties for the
company. Major Sharma urged his company to fight the enemy tenaciously. Realising the
seriousness of the situation and the direct threat that would result to both the aerodrome and
Srinagar if the enemy's advance was not halted until the time reinforcement from 1 KUMAON
could be rushed to close the gap leading to Srinagar via Humhama.
He repeatedly ran across the wide terrain, exposing himself to heavy and precise fire, to his
sections, urging with them to hold on. He skillfully targeted the constantly moving attacker with
his section's fire while maintaining his composure. He frequently put himself in the line of fire of
the enemy and spread-out cloth strips to direct our aircraft onto their objective while the enemy
was watching. The officer, whose left hand was in plaster, started manually filling magazines and
giving them to light machine gunners after seeing that casualties had reduced the efficacy of his
light automatics. He was killed in an explosion that was caused by a mortar round that fell directly
in the middle of the ammunition. His last words were “The enemy is only 50 yards from us. We
are heavily outnumbered. We are under devastating fire. I shall not withdraw an inch but will fight
to the last man and the last round.”5
However, his sacrifice did not go in vain. Inspired by their leader’s gallantry and tenacity, the
soldiers continued to fight the enemy for six hours after Major Sharma had been killed. The spirited
defense by 4 KUMAON delayed the enemy for six crucial hours, thus gaining time for
reinforcements to get into position. However, by the time the relief company of 1st Battalion
Kumaon Regiment reached Badgam, the position had suffered heavy damage. Along with Major
5 Param Vir: Our Heroes in Battle. Maj Gen Ian Cardozo. (2003). The Lotus Collection, Roli Books Pvt. Ltd. New Delhi,
India.Somnath Sharma, one Junior-commissioned officer and twenty other soldiers of the D company
of 4 KUMAON had been killed in battle.6
Despite the fact that 4 KUMAON had suffered over 20 casualties, it had inflicted much heavier
losses on the enemy. The raiders had lost over 200 men and their leader had been incapacitated,
resulting in their advance losing its impetus. This also bought time for additional Indian troops to
land at the airport, reorganize and block all routes of ingress to Srinagar.
His heroic example caused the attackers to be held up for six hoursgaining us more time to position
our reinforcements at Humhama, wherethe raiders advance was to be countered. His men were
motivated to battle the enemy seven to one for one hour after this brave officer was killed. He has
set an example of courage and qualities seldom equaled in the history of the Indian Army.

2022)
https://www.thebetterindia.com/73888/major-somnath-sharma-first-param-vir-chakra-recipient/","CITATION IN RESPECT OF IC-521 MAJOR SOMNATH SHARMA
On 03 Nov 1947, Major Somnath Sharma's company was ordered on a fighting patrol to
Badgam in the Kashmir Valley. He reached his objective at first light on 03 Nov and took up
a position south of Badgam at 1100 hours. The enemy, estimated at 500, attacked his company
position with three sides, the company began to sustain heavy casualties.
Fully realizing the gravity of the situation and the direct threat that would result to both the
aerodrome and Srinagar if the enemy attack was not held until reinforcements could
be rushed to close the gap leading to Srinagar via Humhama, Major Sharma urged his
company to fight the enemy tenaciously. With extreme bravery, he kept rushing across
the open ground to his sections exposing himself to heavy and accurate fire to urge them to
hold on. Keeping his nerve, he skillfully directed the fire of his section into the ever-
advancing enemy. He repeatedly exposed himself to the full fury of enemy fire and laid out
cloth strips to guide our aircraft onto their target in full view of the enemy.
Realising that casualties had affected the effectiveness of his light automatics, this officer,
whose left hand was in plaster, personally commenced filling magazines and issuing them
to light machine gunners. A mortar shell landing right in the middle of the ammunition
resulted in an explosion that killed him.
Major Sharma's company held onto its position and the remnants withdrew only when almost
completely surrounded. His inspiring example resulted in the enemy being delayed for
six hours. Thus, gaining time for our reinforcements to get into position at Humhama to
stem the tide of the enemy advance. His leadership, gallantry and tenacious defence were such
that his men were inspired to fight the enemy by seven to one for six hours, one hour which
was after this gallant officer had been killed.
He has set an example of courage and qualities seldom equaled in the history of the Indian
Army.

IC-7244,Second Lieutenant,Rama Raghoba Rane,Engineer,"Major (then Second Lieutenant) Rama Raghoba Rane was born on 26 June 1918 in Chendia
village in Karwar district of Karnataka. Born in a Konkan Kshatriya Maratha community,
Second Lieutenant Rama Raghoba Rane had his education in different parts of the country
because of his father’s job. In the 1930s, while growing up , he was greatly influenced by the
call of Mahatma Gandhi, asking the youth to demand freedom from the British reign. Rama
Raghoba Rane began taking part in the campaigns related to the non-cooperative movement.
When his father came to know about his affiliation with the movement, Second Lieutenant Rane
was sent back to his ancestral village at Chendia. At the age of 22, Second Lieutenant Rane
decided to join the British Indian Army, while the Second World War was in full swing. On 10
July 1940, Rane enlisted in the Bombay Engineer Regiment, and passed out as the ""Best
Recruit"". He was handed Commandant’s Cane for his outstanding performance. Subsequently,
he was promoted to Naik.
After his training, Second Lieutenant Rane was posted to the 28th Field Company, an Engineer
unit of the 26th Infantry Division which, at the time, was fighting the Japanese in Burma. As his
Division retreated from the Japanese after the failed Arakan Campaign, he, along with his two
Sections, was hand-picked by his Company Commander to stay back behind at Buthidaung to
destroy key assets and then be evacuated by the Royal Indian Navy. Though the objective was
soon achieved, the expected pickup did not happen. This forced Second Lieutenant Rane and his
men to cross a river that was patrolled by the Japanese to reach their lines. Second Lieutenant
Rane, along with his two Sections, skilfully evaded the Japanese troops, and joined the 26th
Infantry Division at Bahri. For his actions, he was promoted to Havildar.
Second Lieutenant Rane later received a Viceroy's Commission as a Jemadar (now the rank of
Naib Subedar). For his dedication, commitment, hard work and leadership qualities, Rane was
selected for a Short Service Commission prior to the partition. In 1947, following the country's
independence, Second Lieutenant Rane remained in the Indian Army and was commissioned in
the Corps of Engineers on 15 December 1947 as a Second Lieutenant. As a young officer Major
Rama Raghoba Rane played a vital role in Indo-Pak War of 1947-48. He proved his mettle as an
outstanding soldier in Indo-Pak War and was given the nation’s highest gallantry award, “Param
Vir Chakra”.Second Lieutenant Rama Raghoba Rane receiving PVC from the President Dr Rajendra Prasad

After the war, Rane was promoted to Lieutenant on 14 January 1950 and to Captain on 14
January 1954. On 27 May 1955, he received a regular commission as a Captain, with the service
number IC-7244. In July 1954, he was awarded the Chief of Army Staff's Commendation Card
for devotion to duty for his work during the Maha Prabhu Mela in Kashmir. He then went on to
command a Bomb-Disposal Platoon and retired as a Major on 25 June 1968. But his love for the
Army did not let him leave. He continued to serve in the Army until 07 April 1971 at which time
he retired from the Services.
Second Lieutenant Rane married Rajeshwari on 03 February 1955 and the couple had three sons
and a daughter. After retirement, he settled down in Pune. Besides the PVC, Second Lieutenant
Rane also received five “Mention-in-Dispatches” and a Commendation by the Chief of Army
Staff during his Service career. In 1994, Major Rane passed away at the age of 73, at Command
Hospital, Southern Command in Pune after undergoing an operation where the doctors were not
able to stop his bleeding. He is survived by his wife Mrs Rajeshwari Rane, who continues to live
in Pune.Major Rama Raghoba Rane with his wife and children

The Bombay Engineering Group also referred to as the Bombay Sappers informally, are a
regiment of the Indian Army Corps of Engineers. The Bombay Sappers draw their origin from
the erstwhile Bombay Presidency army of the British Raj. The headquarters of this regiment islocated at Khadki, Pune, Maharashtra. The Bombay Sappers have gone on to win many
accolades in battle throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, both before and after Independence,
including the British Victoria Cross and the French Legion of Honour before independence.1
Bombay Sappers celebrated its bicentenary anniversary in 2020. In these 200 years, they have
served in nearly every major battle as well as humanitarian efforts including helping flood
victims and building bridges and railroad tracks. In 1820, a group of Engineer Lascars were
raised and organised under an Engineer Officer into a company known as Sappers and Miners.
Even though the Bombay Sappers could trace their lineage back to 1777, when the first
Company of Pioneer Lascars was created, it was in this year that the raising of the Bombay
Sappers came to be formally recognised. The Bombay Sappers have earned 31 Theatre Honours
and 37 Battle Honours in addition to the highest awards for gallantry pre-independence and post-
independence i.e. Victoria Cross, French Legion of Honour, Param Vir Chakra and Ashoka
2
Chakra. The Group has also made its mark in peacetime activities such as sport, adventure, aid
to civil authority and prestigious construction projects. They are renowned for their endurance,
courage and valour on the battlefield.3 Lieutenant General P S Bhagat, was awarded a Victoria
Cross in World War II also belongs to the Bomaby Sappers and the present COAS General
Manoj Pandey is also from Bombay Sappers.

https://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/Bombay_Engineer_GroupThe first Indo-Pak war fought between the independent countries of India and Pakistan began in
1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan were the attempts by Pakistan to annex
the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. On the map of India, the state of
Jammu and Kashmir appeared as a somewhat rectangular projection in the extreme North-West
corner of the sub-continent. In size it was the largest of the Indian ‘Princely States’ during the
pre-independence era. It was 222,870sq km or roughly double the area of Demark, the
Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg combined. The state was important because of its strategic
location. Even before the birth of Pakistan, Jammu and Kashmir was surrounded on almost three
sides by foreign states. Today, its importance has been accentuated by recent international
developments. To the East lay Tibet; to its North lies Chinese Turkestan or Sinkiang (Xinjiang);
to West is Afghanistan; to South-West and South was Pakistan; and to the South and South-East
lay the states of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh of India.4 The narrow Wakhan corridor, a narrow
strip of territory in Afghanistan, extending to China and separating Tajikistan from Gilgit-
Baltistan, was to the North West.
After recapturing Jhangar, Naushera by 50 Para Brigade and 19 Infantry Brigade from Pakistani
hands on 18 March 1948, the Indian Army's next move was to capture and secure the Rajauri
district. It was decided that the Indian forces should go on the offensive. The enemy held a
number of defiles along the axis of advance, carried out extensive demolitions and erected
numerous roadblocks. The advance required the capture of Barwali Ridge, Chingas and Rajauri
in successive phases. The advance commenced on 08 April, and the ridge was captured the same
evening. The enemy counter attacked but this was beaten back. The advance thereafter took
place along the hills on either side of the road. Chingas was captured by the morning of 10 April.
It was during this advance that a young Engineer Officer, Second Lieutenant Rama Raghoba
Rane, cleared extensive mines along the axis at grave risk to himself to enable the armoured
column to move on. Second Lieutenant Rane was in command of the 37th Assault Field
Company, which was tasked to clear out the obstructions so that the columns can move forward
safely. On 08 April 1948, Pakistani forces began a heavy bombardment of the Indian position, at
1100 Hours. Second Lieutenant Rane and his party were waiting near the tanks to begin the work
of clearing the mines ahead. As a result, two members of the mine-clearing party were killed and
five others, including Second Lieutenant Rane, were wounded. Despite being injured, he
continued to clear out the roadblocks fearlessly under incessant enemy fire. The officer
immediately reassembled his team and got to work getting the tanks to their position.

Defence,Government of IndiaThroughout the day he was near the tanks, constantly being attacked by hostile enemy machine
guns and mortars.5
Even though he was aware that the enemy had not yet been entirely driven out of the region
following the capture of Barwali Ridge at around 1630 hours, Second Lieutenant Rane led his
party ahead and began preparing a detour for the tanks. He continued to work until 2200 hours
that night in plain view of the enemy under heavily machine-gun fire. On 09 April he again
started work at 0600 hours and worked on till 1500 hours, when the diversion was prepared for
the tanks to go forward. He boarded the leading carrier and moved ahead as the armoured
column advanced. After proceeding about half a mile he came across a roadblock made of pine
trees. He immediately got down his horse and blasted the trees. The advance kept going. The
same story was repeated after 300 yards. By this time it was getting on to 1700 hours. The road
was curving round the hill like a snake. The next roadblock was a demolished culvert. Second
Lieutenant Rane again got on with the job. Before he could begin his task, the enemy opened fire
with their machine guns, but because of his amazing leadership and courage, he made a diversion
and the column moved forward. Despite the increasing number of obstacles in his path, he
continued to blast them. It was now 1815 hours, and light was fading fast. The carrier came
across a formidable roadblock of five big pine trees surrounded by mines and covered by
machine-gun fire. He began removing the mines and was determined to remove the roadblock,
but the commander of the armoured column took note of the situation and manoeuvred the
column into a harbour area.
On 10 April 1948 at 0445 hours, Second Lieutenant Rane resumed working on the roadblock in
spite of machine-gun fire with the support of one troops of tanks. He managed to get through this
obstacle by 06:30. The following 1,000 yards were filled with barriers and demolished
embankments. That was not all. The enemy had the entire region under machine-gun fire, but
even though he was injured, he displayed his extraordinary efforts, cool leadership, and disregard
for his own safety, he cleared the route by 1030 hours.
While Second Lieutenant Rane continued to prepare the road for the administrative column, the
armoured column advanced and got off the road into the Tawi riverbed. The tanks reached
Chingas by 1400 hours. Second Lieutenant Rane appreciating that the opening of the road was
most vital, continued working without rest or food till 2100 hours that night. On 11 April 1948,
He once again got to work at 0600 hours and opened opening the road to Chingas by 1100 hours.
He worked on that night till 2200 hours clearing the road ahead. Despite all obstacles, Second

11 April 1948 contributed greatly to the success of the objective.
Second Lieutenant Rama Raghoba Rane’s superhuman efforts despite being wounded, cool
courage, exemplary leadership and complete disregard for personal safety enabled the Indian
tanks to reach Chingas. He was awarded the Param Vir Chakra for most conspicuous gallantry in
the face of enemy.","On 8 April 1948, Second Lieutenant Rama Raghoba Rane, Bombay Engineers, was ordered to be
in charge of the mine and roadblock clearing party at Mile 26 on the Naushera-Rajouri road
which passes through very hilly country.
At 1100 Hours, on that date near Nadpur South, just as Second Lieutenant Rane and his party
were waiting near the tanks to start the work of clearing the mines ahead, the enemy started
heavy mortaring of the area, with the result that two men of the mine-clearing party were killed
and five others including Second Lieutenant Rane were wounded. The officer at once
reorganized his party and started work for the tanks to go on to their position. Throughout the
day he was near the tanks under heavy enemy machine-gun and mortar fire.
After the capture of Barwali Ridge at about 1630 hours, although knowing that the enemy had
not been completely cleared of the area, Second Lieutenant Rane took his party ahead and started
making a diversion for the tanks to proceed. He worked on till 2200 hours that night in full view
of the enemy and under heavy machine-gun fire.
On 9 April he again started work at 0600 hours and worked on till 1500hrs when the diversion
was ready for the tanks to proceed. As the armoured column advanced, he got into the leading
carrier and proceeded ahead. After proceeding about half a mile he came across a roadblock
made of pine trees. He at once dismounted and blasted the trees away. The advance continued.
Another 300 yards and the same story was repeated. By this time it was getting on to 1700 hours.
The road was curving round the hill like a snake. The next roadblock was a demolished culvert.
Second Lieutenant Rane again got on with the job. Before he could start work, the enemy opened
up with their machine-guns, but with super courage and leadership he made a diversion and the
column proceeded ahead. The roadblocks were becoming numerous but he blasted his way
through. It was now 1815 hours, and light was fading fast. The carrier came across a formidable
roadblock of five big pine trees surrounded by mines and covered by machine-gun fire. He
started removing the mines and was determined to clear the roadblock but the armoured column
commander appreciating the situation got the column into a harbour area.
On 10 April 1948 at 0445 hours, Second Lieutenant Rane again started work on the roadblock in
spite of machine-gun fire with the support of one troops of tanks. With sheer will power he
cleared this roadblock by 0630hours. The next thousand yards was a mass of roadblocks and
blasted embankments. That was not all. The enemy had the whole area covered with machine-
gun fire but with superhuman efforts, in spite of having been wounded, with cool courage andexemplary leadership and complete disregard for personal life, he cleared the road by 1030
hours.
The armoured column proceeded ahead and got off the road into the riverbed of the Tawi but
Second Lieutenant Rane continued clearing the road for the administrative column. The tanks
reached Chingas by 1400 hours. Second Lieutenant Rane appreciating that the opening of the
road was most vital, continued working without rest or food till 2100 hours that night.
On 11 April 1948, he again started work at 0600 hours and opened the road to Chingas by 1100
hours. He worked on that night till 2200 hours clearing the road ahead.

District Churu, Rajasthan. He was the youngest among his siblings. He joined the Indian Army on
20 May 1936 at the age of 18. He had initially served in 10/1 PUNJAB and 5/1 PUNJAB and later
participated in World War II.1 Within a few years after joining the army, he passed the Indian
Army First Class certificate of Education and was promoted to the rank of Lance Naik on 07
August 1940. In September 1941, he was posted as an instructor at the Punjab Regimental Centre
and was appointed as Company Havildar Major in May 1945.2 Later when he returned from the
war in September 1947, he was assigned to the 6 RAJPUTANA RIFLES because the Indian Army
had been reorganised. During the Indo-Pak War of 1947-1948, CHM Piru Singh participated in
the Battle at Darapari in Tithwal in J&K, where he fought gallantly and displayed exemplary
leadership.
Rajputana Rifles is the senior most rifle regiment of the Indian Army. Its first battalion was raised
in January 1775. The Rajputana Rifles has a long and glorious history. The regiment took part in
some of the bloodiest battles in many theatres of the world. During World War II, the battalions
of this regiment fought in every theatre in which the Indian Army was involved. Three of them,
the 1st, 4th and medium machine gun battalions fought in Eritrea in North Africa and Italy as part
of the famous 4th Indian Division, whose fighting record was one of the finest in World War II.
Post-independence the regiment took part in many battles and operations including the UN
Peacekeeping Mission in Congo. The Rajputana Rifles fought gallantly in the 1965 and 1971 India
Pakistan wars.

Darapari is a hill feature in Tithwal Valley over 1100 feet high. 6 RAJPUTANA RIFLES was
tasked to capture Tithwal valley. The battalion was informed that the enemy did not have enough
time to dig-in extensively and therefore could be easily dislodged. However, the information
received was inaccurate and the battalion did not have enough time to conduct proper
reconnaissance of the enemy position. The attack for the capture of Darapari was to take place at
0130 Hr on the night of 17/18 July 1948. CHM Piru Singh’s platoon was leading the assault. When
platoon commander Subedar Bhika Singh was hit, CHM Singh took command and led his gallant
platoon against the murderous fire coming from the enemy deployed in well-dug trenches and
bunkers on high ground.
D Company, of which CHM Piru Singh was part of, was detailed to attack and capture an enemy-
occupied hill feature at South of Tithwal. The enemy had well dug in their positions, sited MMG
to coverlikely approaches. D Company's offensive was greeted with strong MMG fire from both
flanks as it approached. The enemy lobbed grenades and brought down heavy fire at CHM Singh’s
platoon from their bunkers. Company Havildar Major Piru Singh was then assigned to the
company's forward-most section. He remained steadfast despite seeing more than half of the
section slain or wounded. He encouraged the remaining men with battle cries and moved forward
with tremendous purpose onto the nearest enemy MMG position. With complete disregard to his
personal safety, he continued to advance, despite grenade splinters shredding his garments. Taking
over the MMG position he neutralised the enemy gun crew with stengun fire.
In a daring act, he jumped on the MMG crew bayoneting them to death. CHM Singh realised that
he was the sole survivor of the section and the rest were either dead or wounded. Shortly later,
another grenade was thrown at him, which wounded his face. With blood dripping from his
wounds on his face, he crawled out of the trench, hurling grenades at the next enemy position. He
gave a loud battle cry, then jumped on the occupants of the next trench bayonetting two to death.
As he came from the second trench to charge the third enemy bunker, he was shot in the head by
a bullet and last seen falling into the enemy trench. There was an explosion in the trench, indicating
that his grenades had done their job.

South of Tithwal, ‘D’ Company, of which No 2831592 Piru Singh, was Havildar Major was
detailed to attack and capture an enemy-occupied hill feature. The enemy had well dug in positions
and had sited his MMGs so as to cover all possible approaches. As the attack advanced, it was met
with heavy MMG fire from both flanks. Volleys of grenades were hurled down from enemy
bunkers. Company Havildar Major Piru Singh was then with the forward-most section of the
company. Seeing more than half of the Section killed or wounded, he did not lose courage. With
battle cries, he encouraged the remaining men and rushed forward with great determination onto
the nearest enemy MMG position. Grenade splinters ripping his clothes and wounding him at
several places, he continued to advance without the least regard for his safety. He was on top of
the MMG position wounding the gun crew with Sten gunfire. With complete disregard for his
bleeding wounds, he made a mad jump on the MMG crew bayoneting them to death, thus silencing
the gun. By then he suddenly realized that he was the sole survivor of the section, the rest of them
either dead or wounded. Another grenade thrown at him wounded him in the face. With blood
dripping from his face wounds in his eyes, he crawled out of the trench, hurling grenades at the
next enemy position.
With a loud battle cry, he jumped on the occupants of the next trench bayonetting two to death.
This action was witnessed by C company Commander who was directing fire in support of the
attacking Company.
As Havildar Major Piru Singh emerged out of the 2nd trench to charge on the 3rd enemy bunker
he was hit in the head by a bullet and was seen dropping on the edge of the enemy trench. There
was an explosion in the trench which showed that his grenades had done its work. By then CHM
Piru Singh’s wounds had proved fatal.
He had paid with his life for his singularly brave act but he had left for the rest of his comrades a
unique example of single-handed bravery and determined cold courage.

community, and his village was close to Shakargarh (in the former United Punjab), and his family
later relocated to Jangal, in Gudaspur district of Punjab. His parents were Munshi Ram and Smt.
Dhan Devi. He enrolled in the prestigious King George Royal Indian Military College in Bangalore
in 1946 before transferring to the King George Royal Military College in Jalandhar (Now
Rashtriya Military School Chail in Himachal Pradesh). Captain Gurbachan Singh Salaria was later
Joined the National Defence Academy as part of its the 9th Course and was in Bravo Squadron.
He was subsequently commissioned from the Indian Military Academy, DehraDun into the 1
GORKHA RIFLES on 09 June 1957.
The first battalion of the Gorkha Regiment was raised in April 1815, after the Anglo-Nepalese
War. At the time of Indian independence in 1947, 3/1 GORKHA RIFLES was transferred to
the Indian Army as part of the Tripartite Agreement signed between India, Nepal and Britain. Prior
to independence, the regiment was known as the 3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles. In
1950, the regiment's title was changed to 3 GORKHA RIFLES. Since 1947, the regiment has
participated in a number of wars and conflict situations including the 1947-48 and 1971 wars
between India and Pakistan. The regiment has five battalions – 1/1 GR, 2/1 GR, 3/1 GR, 4/1 GR

(Source: https://wikibio.in/captain-gurbachan-singh-salaria/)The Republic of Congo (now Democratic Republic of Congo) gained independence from its
colonial master, Belgium, in 1960. However, the newly independent nation soon descended into a
series of conflicts. The Congolese government appealed to the United Nations (UN) for aid and
assistance of a multilateral force to contain the violence and maintain peace in the strife-torn
country. The ONUC was established on 14 July 1960 under the United Nations Security Council
Resolution 143. The initial mandate of ONUC was to ensure the withdrawal of Belgian forces
from the Republic of the Congo, assist the Congolese government in maintaining law and order,
and provide technical assistance. Subsequently, ONUC became embroiled in a chaotic internal
situation of extreme complexity and had to be converted into an UN peacekeeping operation which
allowed limited use of military force. The Force was designed to protect the Congo from outside
interference, particularly by evacuating foreign mercenaries and advisers from Katanga and
preventing clashes and civil strife, by force, as a last resort. In 1961-62, secessionist gendarmes
under the command of foreign mercenaries clashed with the UN Force. At its peak, ONUC had
20,000 troops, including a brigade from India. In February 1963, after Katanga had been
reintegrated into the national territory of Congo, ONUC began to be phased out. It was finally
dissolved on 30 June 1964.
From 02 December 1961, onwards the number of violent incidents in Katanga increased and
ultimately led to open hostilities. The Gendarmerie started attacking the UN troops and setup road
blocks. On 05 December, 1961, under Operation UNOKART, 3/1 GORKHA RIFLES were
tasked to clear a roadblock by the gendarmerie set up at a vital intersection in Elizabethville,
Katanga. Captain Gurbachan Singh Salaria was entrusted with this responsibility. The ideas was
to that two sections of Gorkhas will march toward this roadblock from the airfield to function as a
cutting-off force while one company and two Swedish armoured personnel carriers would attack
the position frontally. At around 1312 Hours, Captain Salaria and his small force approached the
roadblock from a distance of 1500 yards, when they came under heavy automatic and small-arms
fire from an undetected enemy position positioned on his right flank. Along with two armoured
vehicles, the opposition to Captain Salaria's small squad included roughly 90 men.
Along with two armoured vehicles, the opposition to Captain Salaria's small squad included
roughly 90 men. Captain Salaria made the decision to clear this obstruction after realising that he
had ran into a side roadblock and ambush and that this enemy force might fortify the strategic
roundabout and jeopardize the main operation. He led a charge while armed with a rocket launcher,
khukris, and bayonets. Captain Salaria engaged the enemy in a valiant battle, killing 40 of them
while knocking out two armoured vehicles. Despite having a numerical advantage and safe
positions, the enemy retreated as a result of this unexpectedly brave move. However, a burst of
automatic fire struck Captain Salaria in the neck, but he kept fighting until he passed out from
excessive bleeding.A major factor in the success of the main battalion's operation at the roundabout and in preventing
the encirclement of UN Headquarters in Elizabethville was Captain Salaria's valiant action, which
stopped any enemy movement of the enemy force towards the main battle scene. Despite the
enemy's numerical advantage and tactical advantage, Captain Salaria's personal example,
in complete disregard for personal safety, and fearless leadership encouraged his small but valiant
force of 16 Gorkhas to hang on to their position, dominate the enemy, and inflict significant
casualties. The Indian Army's traditions were best upheld by Captain Salaria's leadership bravery,
unwavering devotion to duty, and disregard for personal safety.
On 23 January 2023, on the occasion of Parakram Diwas, 21 largest unnamed islands of Andaman

Captain Gurbachan Singh Salaria called “Salaira Dweep”.","CAPTAIN GURBACHAN SINGH SALARIA (IC-8497), 3/1 GORKHA RIFLES
On 05 December 1961, 3/1 Gorkha Rifles was ordered to clear a roadblock established by the
gendarmerie at a strategic roundabout at Elizabethville, Katanga. The plan was that one company
with 2 Swedish armoured cars would attack the position frontally and Captain Gurbachan Singh
Salaria with two sections of Gorkhas and two Swedish armoured personnel carriers would advance
towards this roadblock from the airfield to act as a cutting-off force.
Captain Salaria with his small force arrived at a distance of 1500 yards from the roadblock at
approximately 1312 hours on 05 December 1961 and came under heavy automatic and small-arms
fire from an undetected enemy position dug in on his right flank. The enemy also had two armoured
cars and about 90 men opposing Captain Salaria’s small force.
Captain Salaria appreciating that he had run into a subsidiary roadblock and ambush and that this
enemy force might reinforce the strategic roundabout and thus jeopardise the main operation,
decided to remove this opposition. He led a charge with bayonets, khukris, and grenades supported
by a rocket launcher. In this gallant engagement, Captain Salaria killed 40 of the enemy and
knocked out the two armoured cars. This unexpected bold action completely demoralised the
enemy who fled despite their numerical superiority and protected positions.
Captain Salaria was wounded in his neck by a burst of automatic fire but continued to fight till he
collapsed due to profuse bleeding. Captain Salaria’s gallant action prevented any enemy movement
of the enemy force towards the main battle scene and thus contributed very largely to the success
of the main battalion’s action at the roundabout and prevented the encirclement of UN
Headquarters in Elizabethville.
Captain Salaria’s personal example, utter disregard for personal safety and dauntless leadership
inspired his small but gallant force of 16 Gorkhas to hold on to their position, dominate the enemy
and inflict heavy casualties despite the enemy’s superiority in numbers and tactical position.
Captain Salaria’s leadership courage, unflinching devotion to duty and disregard for personal
safety were best in the traditions of Indian Army.

IC-7990,Major,Dhan Singh Thapa,INFANTRY),"Lieutenant Colonel (then Major) Dhan Singh Thapa was born on 28 April 1928, in Shimla,
Himachal Pradesh. His father Mr PS Thapa and mother were of Nepalese origin. Lieutenant
Colonel Dhan Singh Thapa was commissioned into 1/8 GORKHA RIFLES of Indian Army on 28
August 1949. He was a devoted soldier and did his duty with great enthusiasm. Along with being
a devoted soldier, he is remembered for being excellent sportsman who exhibited extraordinary
football skills. After few years of his service in Indian Army he married his wife Mrs Shukla Thapa
and had three children Poornima Thapa, Poonma Thapa and Param Deep Thapa. During the Sino-
India of 1962, Major Dhan Singh was posted in Ladakh at Sirijap Post established by his battalion
1/8 GORKHA RIFLES.
The first battalion of Gurkha Regiment (now Gorkha Rifles) was raised in 1815 during the Anglo-
Nepalese war. Impressed by the qualities displayed by Gurkhas during the war, the British started
active recruitment of Gurkhas into the British Indian army. After the partition, in 1947 six Gurkha
regiments viz, 1 GR, 3 GR, 4 GR, 5 GR, 8 GR and 9 GR remained with the Indian Army, while 2
GR, 6 GR, 7 GR and 10 GR were transferred to British Army as part of the Tripartite Agreement
signed between India, Nepal and Britain. The 8 GR was raised in 1824 as a part of British East
Indian Company and later was transferred to British Indian Army after the First War of
Independence of 1857. The regiment participated in World War I and World War II. Since
independence, the regiment has proved its mettle in Sino-India War of 1962 and Indo-Pak War of
1971. The regiment’s motto is ‘Kafar Hunu Bhanda Marnu Ramro’ (Better to die than live like
a coward). The regiment has given India one of the two Field Marshals, Field Marshal Sam
Manekshaw, of the Indian Army. In 1962 Sino-India war, Lieutenant Colonel Dhan Singh Thapa
of 1/8 GR was awarded Param Vir Chakra for the display of conspicuous courage and exemplary
leadership in the battle of Sirijap, Ladakh. The battalion was subsequently mechanised and later
re-designated as 3 MECHANISED INFANTRY.Source: https://wikibio.in/dhan-singh-thapa/
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after its
establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant diplomatic
status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state recognition
of PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into negotiations with
China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement in 1954. Within a few
weeks of Chou Enlai’s visit to India in 1954, the Chinese launched a protest against the presence
of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometers south of a border pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh.
This was the first time, the Government of China laid claim to any part of Indian territory formally.
The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957, marked a turning point in the Sino-India
relations as the Chinese occupied a large part of the Aksai Chin. This opened an opportunity for
China to come out with territorial claims against India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved
in further into Ladakh and established themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal, just
south of Dambu Guru. On 08 September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Post
in the Eastern sector and began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in the Eastern
sector in Namka Chu sector as well as in the Western sector in Ladakh. The overwhelming number
of the Chinese troops attacked the Indian soldiers but they fought the enemy with grit anddetermination. The Chinese announced the cease-fire at midnight of 21/22 November 1962.1 The
war in the west was fought in Ladakh.
Ladakh, a part of frontier province of Jammu and Kashmir, is also part of the Greater Himalayan
Range. The mountains of Ladakh, perhaps the most rugged and inhospitable in the world are
formidable. On the night of 19/20 October 1962, the Chinese forces attacked Chip-Chap, Galwan
and Pangong area of Ladakh. Despite the fact that these posts were isolated and lacked fire support,
the Indian Army fought bravely but were overrun by the enemy who was superior in numbers.

Lieutenant Colonel (then Major) Dhan Singh Thapa was commanding the forward post in Sirijap.
After receiving intensive mortar bombardment and artillery fire, the post was attacked by the
Chinese on 20 October 1962 with overwhelming strength. Under his brave leadership, the heavily
outnumbered position repulsed the attack, suffering severe losses at the hands of the attackers.
After being heavily shelled by mortar and artillery fire, the enemy assaulted once more, this time
in greater numbers. Major Thapa and his men successfully repulsed this assault while inflicting
significant casualties on the enemy. The Chinese launched a third onslaught, this time with tanks
backing up their infantry. The preceding attacks had left the post with a significant number of

finally overran the post, Major Thapa emerged from his trench and engaged many enemy soldiers
in a hand-to-hand combat until he was overpowered by the Chinese troops. On 21 October 1962,
the Chinese switched their objective to the north of Pangong. 1/8 GORKHA RIFLES which was
at the Sirijap fought it out to the end holding the enemy long enough to allow the Yula post to
withdraw in storm boats. Except for one who escaped, and two who were later known to have been
captured, the Gorkhas all died fighting till very last. Major Thapa's conspicuous bravery, evident
fighting prowess, and exemplary leadership during the battle reflected the greatest ideals of the
Indian Army.

attack, inflicting heavy casualties on the aggressors. The enemy attacked again in greater numbers
after heavy shelling by artillery and mortar fire. Under the leadership of Major Thapa, his men
repulsed this attack also with heavy losses to the enemy.
The Chinese attacked for the third time, now with tanks to support their infantry. The post had
already suffered large casualties in the earlier attacks. Though considerably thinned, it held out to

Jodhpur, Rajasthan. Being born in a military family, he aspired to join the army from a very young
age. He was commissioned into the Indian Army on 01 August 1949 in 13 KUMAON. He took
part in the 1961 liberation of Goa. During the Sino-India War of 1962, Major Shaitan Singh fought
valiantly during the Battle of Rezang La against overwhelming number of Chinese.
The KUMAON Regiment traces its origins to the 18th century and has fought in every major
campaign of the British Indian Army and the Indian Army including the two world wars. During
World War I, a Kumaon battalion was raised at Ranikhet on 23 October 1917 as 34/39th Kumaon
Rifles. In 1918, it was redesigned as 1st battalion, 50th Kumaon Rifles and a second battalion was
raised. These were merged with Hyderabad contingent into the 19th Hyderabad Regiment in 1923.
On 27 October 1945, the 19th Hyderabad was renamed as 19 Kumaon Regiment. Post-
Independence, it has been known as the Kumaon Regiment. Staying true to the regimental motto
of Parakramo Vijayate (Valour Triumphs) the regiment has proved its mettle in Indo-Pak War of
1947-48, Sino-India War of 1962, Indo-Pak War 1971, Kargil War of 1999 and also participated
in the Indian Peace-keeping Force in Sri Lanka. During the Sino-India War of 1962, 13 KUMAON

altitude for the first time. The Chinese troops in this sector was from the mountains and were better
equipped and well trained to fight in inhospitable terrain. The attack in this sector started on 18
November, coinciding with the attack on Sela in NEFA. The Chinese launched a two-pronged
attack on Chushul defences. The Northern prong attacked Gurung Hill and the second prong of the
Chinese troops attacked Charlie Company of 13 KUMAON which was the Ahir company at
Rezang La, an isolated feature, about 11 km South of Spangur Gap. Rezang La dominated the life
line of the Chushul garrison- the road link with Leh that went via Dungti. On 18 November 1962,
the Chinese approached the Indian position through the nallahs that came up to the hill top. At
around 0500 hours, 13 KUMAON defending Rezang La opened up with every weapon they had.
After nearly half an hour of intense firing in the first round, the Chinese took shelter behind
boulders. At about 0540 Hr the Chinese opened artillery and mortar fire at the Indian troops. The
telephone lines of the battalion HQ got cut and the radio set was destroyed. The fight at Rezang
La was hard and bitter. Notwithstanding the disadvantages of climate, terrain and weapons, Major

2639985,Company Quarter Master Havildar,Abdul Hamid,4 GRENADIERS,"Company Quarter Master Havildar (CQMH) was born on 01 July 1933, in Dhamupur village in
Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, to Mr. Mohammad Usman and Mrs. Sakina Begum. He had two sisters
and three brothers. He completed his education till eighth standard from a junior high school in
Deva. Due to the grim financial condition of his family, he couldn’t study further and had to join
his father at his family’s tailoring shop. At a very young age he married Rasloon Bibi and couple
had a daughter and four sons. Later, in 1953, at the age of twenty, he joined the Indian Army. He
trained at the Grenadiers Regimental Center in Nasirabad and was posted to 4 GRENADIERS in
1955.
The GRENADIERS are an infantry regiment of the Indian army, which was formerly part of the
Bombay Army and in pre-independence India, the regiment was known as the 4th Bombay
Grenadiers. They distinguished themselves in two world wars and have won battle honours for
Gurez, Assal Uttar, Jarpal and Chakra. 4 GRENADIERS had shown their mettle during the 1962
Sino-Indian war. The battalion was part of the 7 Infantry Brigade and participated in the battle of
Namka Chu against the Chinese. Again, living true to the regimental war cry of ‘Sarvada
Shaktishali’, the battalion displayed exemplary valour and fought the enemy with great
determination during the 1965 India-Pakistan war. 4 GRENADIERS is a unique example of a
battalion that distinguished itself in an intensely fought war without its regular company
commanders and specialist platoon commanders1 CQMH Abdul Hamid of 4 GRENADIERS was
awarded the Param Vir Chakra for attending beyond the call of duty. Initially he served in a rifle
company and was then sidestepped to the Recoil-Less Platoon (RCL). He served with his battalion
in Agra, Amritsar, Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, North-East frontier Agency (NEFA) and Ramgarh.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and
Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our frontiers with Pakistan
have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing, incursions and
intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive measures. These
attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with commendable bravery and
steely resilience, but always with great restrain to not escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak war of
1965 was the second war fought between these two bordering countries. While India was still
recovering from the damages of Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as an opportunity to
acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms of defence

Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This act of illegal
occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak Border Agreement 1960 and
international law as per the United Nations Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in
Kashmir with the launch of Operation Gibraltar. The 1965 war was fought in various sectors
among which, CQMH Abdul Hamid fought in Khem Karan Sector of Punjab.

and commenced frantically to dig down. By the dawn of 08 September, the trenches had gone
down barely three feet. No overhead cover was possible and no camouflage necessary as the
battalion was in the midst of thick sugarcane fields. At 0730 Hr on 08 September, the rumbling of
a large number of enemy tanks were heard. At 0900 Hr a troop of Pattons came astride the road.
The battalion held their fire and when the leading tank was 30 yards away CQMH Abdul Hamid

At 0800 hours on 10 September 1965, Pakistani forces launched an attack with a regiment of Patton
tanks on a vital area ahead of village Chima on the Bhikhiwind road in the Khem Karan Sector.
The attack was preceded by intense artillery shelling. The enemy tanks penetrated the forward
position by 0900 hours. Realising the grave situation, Company Quarter Master Havildar Abdul
Hamid, who was commander of a recoilless gun detachment, moved out to a flanking position,
with his gun mounted on a jeep, under intense enemy shelling and tank fire. Taking an
advantageous position, he knocked out the leading enemy tank, and then swiftly changing his
position he sent another tank up in flames. By this time the enemy tanks in the area spotted him
and brought his jeep under concentrated machine gun and high explosive fire. Undeterred,
Company Quarter Master Havildar Abdul Hamid kept on firing on yet another enemy tank from
his recoilless gun. While so doing he was mortally wounded by an enemy high explosive shell.
Havildar Abdul Hamid's brave action inspired his comrades to put up a gallant fight and to beat
back the heavy tank assault by the enemy. His complete disregard of his personal safety during the
operation and his sustained act of bravery in the face of constant enemy fire were a shining example
not only to his unit but to the whole division and were in the highest traditions of the Indian Army.

IC-5565,Lieutenant Colonel,Ardeshir Burzorji Tarapore,Poona Horse (17 HORSE),"Lieutenant Colonel Ardeshir Burzoji Tarapore fondly remembered as Adi, was born on 18 August
1923 in Bombay to Burzoji Tarapore and Nergish. His ancestor Ratanjiba worked as a military
leader under Shivaji1. At the age of seven, Ardeshir Tarapore was enrolled in Sardar Dastur Boys
School Poona. He distinguished himself in athletics, gymnastics, boxing, swimming, tennis and
cricket. After leaving school, Ardeshir Tarapore was commissioned on 01 January 1942 in the 7
Hyderabad Infantry. He set his heart on joining the armoured regiment of the Hyderabad State
Forces. This dream of his came true when Major General El-Edroos, the Chief-in-Command of
the State Forces witnessed Tarapore’s brave act of jumping into a bay, picking up the grenade and
throwing it away to safety. He was transferred to the 1 Hyderabad Imperial Service Lancers. Later,
after the merger of Hyderabad with the Union of India, his date of commission was revised to 01
January 1945 and was posted in Poona Horse.
POONA HORSE is an armoured regiment of the Indian Army. It was raised on 15 July 1817, as a
result of the Treaty of Poona, concluded on 13 June 1817 between Lord Hasting and Baji Rao II,
the Peshwa. The Honourable Montstuart Elphinstone, who later became the Governor of Bombay
negotiated the Treaty of Poona. It was formed from the 3rd Regiment of Bombay Light Cavalry,
raised at Sirur on 04 May 1820 by Major Peter Delamotte. The Cavalry element of this Force,
which was known as the Poona Auxilliary Horse was later designated as (Prince Albert Victor’s
Own) Poona Horse. It was amalgamated in 1921 as The Poona Horse (17 Queen Victoria’s Own).
In the First World War, the POONA HORSE fought in France, Palestine and Mesopotamia. During
the Second War, the regiment was part of the British Eight Army. Post-Independence, the regiment
was part of Op POLO in Hyderabad in 1948, India-Pakistan War of 1965 as part of 1 Armoured
Division and 1971 as part of 16 (Independent) Armoured Brigade. The regiment was equipped
with Centurions tanks in both these wars and fought in the Shakargarh Bulge. During the 1965
India-Pakistan War, POONA HORSE had was displayed immense skill in the Sialkot Sector
during the tank battle at Phillora, Wazirwali and Butur- Dograndi, and was awarded the Param Vir
Chakra. In the 1971 War the regiment fought at Basantar and Second Lieutenant Arun Kheterpal
won the Param Vir Chakra and the Commandant Lieutenant Colonel (later Lieutenant General)
Hanut Singh was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra. The Battle of Basantar is considered one of the
fiercest tank battles in Indian military history and the unprecedented bravery showed by POONA
HORSE earned praise from Pakistan army and the title ‘Fakhr-e-Hind’.

Dehradun.The Indo-Pak war of 1965 was the second war fought between these the two bordering countries.
While India was still recovering from the damages of Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as
an opportunity to acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms
of defence preparation. The war was initiated on 24 April 1965, when Pakistan Army, attacked our
territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This act
of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak Border Agreement 1960
and international law as per the United Nations Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently
intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation Gibraltar.
POONA HORSE had returned from collective training in April 1965. On 24 April when the
regiment was celebrating the end of a successful training session the order for mobilisation was
received. 1 CORPS was responsible to carry out offensives at Sialkot-Shakargarh Sector. 1 CORPS
was tasked to secure area Pagowal, Phillora, Chawinda and the Tharoh Cross Roads with a view
to securing Marala-Ravi Link Canal (MRLC). POONA HORSE was part of 1 Armoured Division
which was commanded by Major General Rajinder Singh Sparrow, MVC. The regiment was
commanded by of Lieutenant Colonel AB Tarapore. POONA HORSE was ordered to secure the
Tharoh Cross Roads in Phillora by 08 September 1965. The initial attack at Phillora was met with
intense enemy firing. The regiment’s offensive started with a bang, with a shot fired from Major
Narinjan Cheema’s tank on the Pakistani post of Kadral2. After an intense fight the battle at
Phillora was won.

The next phase of the operation moved towards Chawinda. The POONA HORSE was tasked to
isolate Chawinda from the North by establishing a pivot at Wazirwali, to destroy Pakistani armour.
The regiment commenced its advance at 1200 hr after the execution of the first phase was
successfully done by 4 HORSE and 16 CAVALRY. Chawinda was a prominent place from where
the enemy artillery observation posts brought down very heavy and accurate shelling. The next
phase was to capture Jassoran and Butur Dograndi. The POONA HORSE with 8 GARHWAL and
B Company 9 DOGRA were assigned this task. Lieutenant Colonel Tarapore requested the
Brigade Commander 1 Armoured Brigade Brigadier (later Lieutenant General) KK Singh for
permission to move A Squadron out of Wazirwali to reinforce C Squadron in Butur Dograndi. It
was here that Lieutenant Colonel Tarapore passed his famous transmission to his Adjutant, “Hello
25, let us go and join them”3.

At the Battle of Chawinda on 11 September 1965, POONA HORSE launched an attack on Phillora
in the Sialkot area. Lieutenant Colonel Tarapore led the southern thrust of the offensive, which
advanced on the right flank. The offensive was met with a massive armour charge from Wazirwali
by the Pakistani Army between Phillora and Chawinda. Under constant enemy tank and artillery
fire, Lieutenant Colonel Tarapore held his ground and gallantly attacked Phillora. He refused to
be removed after being injured. On 14 September 1965, he led his unit to the capture of Wazirwali,
followed by Jassoran and Butur-Dograndi on 16 September 1965. Despite being hit multiple times,
he kept his pivots in both locations, assisting the supporting infantry attacking Chawinda. Inspired
by his command, the unit attacked the enemy armour, destroying around sixty Pakistani Army
tanks while sustaining only nine tank fatalities. Lt Col Tarapore's tank, on the other hand, was hit
and engulfed in flames, and he died a hero's death.Lieutenant Colonel A.B. Tarapore's heroism during the six-day epic action was in keeping with
the greatest traditions of the Indian Army. He was cremated on 17 September 1965 in Jassoran in
accordance with his desires. His ashes were taken to Poona and later immersed in the Sangram on
29 November 19654. He led with exemplary leadership and immense skill and laid down his life
in the highest tradition of the Indian Army and was awarded Param Vir Chakra posthumously.

On 11 September 1965, the Poona Horse Regiment under the command of Lieutenant Colonel
Ardeshir Burzarji Tarapore was assigned the task of delivering the main armored thrust for
capturing Phillora in the Sialkot Sector in Pakistan. As a preliminary to making a surprise attack
on Phillora from the rear, the regiment was thrusting between Phillora and Chawinda when it was
suddenly counter-attacked by the enemy’s heavy Armour from Wazirwali. Lieutenant Colonel A.
B. Tarapore who was then at the head of his regiment defied the enemy’s charge, held his ground
and gallantly attacked Phillora with one of his squadrons supported by an infantry battalion.
Though under the continuous enemy tank and artillery fire, Lieutenant Colonel A B Tarapore
remained unperturbed throughout this action and when wounded refused to be evacuated. Inspired
by his leadership, the regiment fiercely attacked the enemy heavy armor destroying approximately
60 enemy tanks at a cost of only 9 tank casualties, and when Lieutenant Colonel A. B Tarapore
was mortally wounded the regiment continues to defy the enemy.
On 11 September 1965, the 17 Horse regiment launched an attack on Phillora in the Sialkot sector
at the Battle of Chawinda. The southern thrust of the attack, commanded by Lt. Col. Tarapore
advanced on the right flank. Between Phillora and Chawinda, the attack met with the Pakistani
Army‘s heavy armour charge from Wazirwali. Lt. Col. Tarapore held his ground and gallantly
attacked Phillora under the continuous enemy tank and artillery fire. When wounded, he refused
to be evacuated. He led his regiment to capture Wazirwali on 14 September, and Jassoran and
Butur-Dograndi on 16 September 1965. Though his own tank was hit several times, he maintained
his pivots at both these places and thereby helped the supporting infantry attacking Chawinda.
Inspired by his leadership, the regiment fiercely attacked the enemy armor and destroyed
approximately sixty Pakistani Army tanks, suffering only nine tank casualties. However, Lt Col
Tarapore’s tank was hit and was enveloped in flames and he died a hero’s death. The valor
displayed by Lt Col A.B. Tarapore in this heroic action, which lasted six days, was in keeping with
the highest traditions of the Indian Army.

The Battle of Basantar is considered one of the fiercest tank battles in Indian military history and
the unprecedented bravery showed by 17 HORSE earned praise from Pakistan army and the title
‘Fakhr-e-Hind’.
India gained Independence in 1947, and the partition resulted in the creation of Pakistan. The
foundation of Pakistan was laid by the Muslim League based on the two-nation theory. Pakistan
comprised two wings- East and West Pakistan which were geographically separated by 1600 kms
Indian territory. The two wings of Pakistan were culturally and linguistically different and the
diversities between the two wings could not be bridged by an emotional appeal to religion.
Consequently, fissures started erupting in the political body of Pakistan soon after the
Independence and with each passing year it widened. In the absence of appropriate defence
arrangements, the people of East Pakistan felt isolated and abandoned. Finally, the malfeasance of
Pakistani leadership during Cyclone Bhola and the overwhelming support for the Awami League
in the 1970 elections, proved the proverbial last straw on the camel’s back.2 The Awami League
led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (of East Pakistan) secured an absolute majority in the general
elections held in December 1970. This entitled the League to form a Government in Pakistan.
However, Pakistan’s military rulers denied this democratic right to the Awami League, in
connivance with the PPP, led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. This arbitrary act of government caused deep
resentment among the population of East Pakistan resulting in widespread protests. When the slide
became unmanageable, the Pakistani rulers resorted to a midnight crackdown on 25 March 1971.
The government ordered a military crackdown and the Pakistan army under Lieutenant General
Tikka Khan unleashed a reign of terror and massacred thousands of Bengalis in a genocide code-
named ‘Operation Searchlight’. Pakistan launched its attack against India on 03 December

services on a large scale. Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal was undergoing the Young Officers’
Course at Ahmednagar at that time. He was recalled from the course and soon joined his unit to
take part in the Battle of Basantar in the Shakargarh sector.
17 HORSE was under the command of 47 Infantry Brigade. They fought in the Battle of Basantar
in Shakargarh Sector. The brigade had already established a bridgehead across the Basantar River
which allowed induction of 17 HORSE tanks. The ensuing battle was among the fiercest of 1971
Indo-Pak war. While for Pakistan it resulted in an astounding loss of 48 Patton Tanks, India won
a stunning victory in enemy territory.
Battle of Basantara
Source: Indian Defence Review
On 16 December 1971, Pakistani Armour launched their first counter attack under the cover of a
smokescreen at Jarpal, targeting the ‘B’ Squadron. When our troops were heavily outnumbered by
enemy forces, the squadron commander asked for reinforcements. Second Lieutenant Arun
Khetarpal, who was in ‘A’ squadron, after hearing this radio transmission responded to the call
and led his troops toward the enemy attack.
On the way his troop were subjected to heavy fire from enemy strongholds and recoilless gun
positions along the route which were still holding out in the bridgehead established by our
men over the Basantar River. On realising that critical situation was developing and prompt actionwas to be taken, Second Lieutenant Khetarpal attacked the enemy strong points, physically
overrunning them, and taking the enemy's infantry soldiers and weapon crews at pistol point.
The commander of one of the tanks in his troops was lulled during this action, but Second
Lieutenant Khetarpal continued to attack fiercely until all resistance was vanquished and he broke
through in the direction of our squadron. When enemy tanks started pulling back after their initial
probing attacks, he chased the enemy tanks and destroyed one of them.
A fierce battle broke out when the enemy launched an armoured squadron attack against the sector
held by three of our tanks, one of which was manned by Second Lieutenant Khetarpal. Ten enemy
tanks were damaged and destroyed, of which Second Lieutenant Khetarpal personally destroyed
four. During the battle, Second Lieutenant Khetarpal's tank was hit and caught fire, leaving him
seriously injured. Upon realising that enemy was still pressing the offensive in this sector,
disregarding his severe wounds, Lieutenant Khetarpal persisted in confronting the enemy despite
the fact that his tank was on fire. Before his tank was hit a second time, he destroyed one more
enemy tank but due to the hit Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal was fatally injured. Due to his
supreme sacrifice, the enemy couldn’t achieve the victory he was so desperately pursuing.

exemplary bravery and devotion to duty, he was awarded Param Vir Chakra posthumously.","On 16 December 1971, when our position at Jarpal in the Shakargarh Sector was subjected to an

burning. He destroyed one more enemy tank before his tank was hit a second time, killing him.
But the enemy had been denied the breakthrough he was seeking so desperately.
In this action Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal displayed the most conspicuous gallantry in the
face of the enemy, indomitable fighting spirit and tenacity of purpose.

IC-32907F,Major,Ramaswamy Parameswaran,8 MAHAR,"Major Ramaswamy Parameswaran was born on 13 September 1946, in Bombay (now Mumbai),
Maharashtra to Mr K S Ramaswamy and Mrs Janaki Ramaswamy. He completed his schooling
from SIES (South Indian Education Society) High School, Mumbai and went on to do his
graduation in science from SIES College. He later joined the OTA in Chennai and passed out on
16 June 1972. He was commissioned into 15 MAHAR of Indian Army and subsequently joined 5
MAHAR while they were fighting insurgency in the hills of Mizoram and Tripura. In 1981,
Major Parameswaran got married to Uma who was a poet and a writer and started his married
life.
Major Parameswaran participated in several counter-insurgency operations in the North East
while serving with the 15 MAHAR and 5 MAHAR battalions. He quickly developed a reputation
for having steely resolve and unwavering leadership abilities. Major Parameswaran,
affectionately known by his soldiers as ""Parry Sahib,"" consistently took the lead during the
difficult tasks that his battalion undertook. He was frequently found in charge of the most
challenging patrols and perilous operations. Taking a group of men into the forests was one of
his favourite pastimes. Dominating the area of responsibility was something he not only
preached but also practised. As a result, even the most dogged and hardened insurgents kept
away from his area for fear of being killed or captured. And yet he was kind and gentle with the
local inhabitants.
Major Parameswaran was specially chosen to serve with the 8 MAHAR, when Op PAWAN was
launched. The battalion was one of the first troops to deploy in Sri Lanka in 1987.

community. Today it is one of the most diverse regiments in the Indian Army. In the 19th
century, they were recruited by the British East India Company and were part of the Company’s
Bombay Army. However, with the introduction of the ‘class regiments’ policy after the First War
of Independence in 1857, the British government demobilised the Mahar troops. When the First
World War broke out in 1914, the British government was forced to expand its recruiting
policies and a Mahar battalion was raised in 1917. After the war ended, the battalion was
disbanded again in March 1921. In 1941, when Dr BR Ambedkar was appointed to the Viceroy’s
Executive Council, he exerted pressure on the British government to enlist the Mahar troops into
the army. In October 1941, 1 MAHAR was raised in Belgaum, thus establishing the origin of the
present-day Mahar Regiment. Between the two wars, the demand to raise Mahar regiment was
constantly raised. The regiment’s war cry is “Bolo Hindustan Ki Jai”. The MAHAR Regiment
has the distinction of having General KV Krishnarao, COAS (01 June 1981 – 31 July 1983) and
General KS Sundarji, COAS (01 February 1986 – 31 May 1988) who belonged to this regiment.
On 29 July 1987, a historic accord known as the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord was signed by then
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President J. R. Jayewardene in Colombo.
According to this agreement, India participated directly in counterinsurgency operations in Sri
Lanka against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) during the Sri Lankan Civil War.1
The Sri Lankan civil war has raged since 1983, making it one of the longest and most intractable
armed conflicts in South Asia.2 It has taken lives of more than 60,000 Sri Lankans, and has made
refugees out of more than 300,000 people. Sri-Lanka occupies a strategic place in the Indian
Ocean region and a multi ethnic and multi religious land. Eighty two percent of the population is
Sinhala and follows Buddhism; and remaining 18 percent are Tamil and predominantly Hindu.
The problem in Sri-Lanka between Sinhalese and Tamil minority started when Tamil felt that
their interests were neglected. To safeguard their rights, Tamils took arms and declared their
intention to achieve ‘Tamil Eelam’- a separate state for Tamils.

The Sri Lanka Government tried to put down the Tamil movement by force but this resulted in
the Tamil’s taking to guerrilla warfare. This soon resulted in a large number of refugees
emigrating to the southern Indian state Tamil Nadu, which created considerable problems for
India. After protracted negotiations, in which leaders of various Tamil groups were involved, an
agreement was arrived at between Sri Lanka and India on 29 July 1987. As per the agreement, an
Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) was inducted into Sri Lanka on 03 August 1987.3 It was
India's first international peacekeeping mission post-independence. The objective was to
eliminate the LTTE from control on the Jaffna Peninsula and impose disarmament. With a total
military strength of 100,000 soldiers, the IPKF ran a classic counter-insurgency (CI) campaign

Major Parameswaran’s battalion, 8 MAHAR, took part in OPERATION PAWAN as part of 91
Infantry Brigade and 54 Infantry Division. They were tasked to oversee the implementation of
Indo-Sri Lanka accord signed on 29 July 1987.The battalion was the first unit to have landed in
Sri Lanka as part of IPKF. The militants were expected to surrender after the arrival of Indian
forces, but the dreaded LTTE pulled out and started waging war on them. The battalion engaged
in several actions against the LTTE while deployed in Sri Lanka, the major ones being at
Maruthanamadam, Annai Kotai Manipai and Kantarodai. It was at Kantarodai where Major
Paramsewaran fought his gallant action.

On 24 November 1987, the battalion received information that a consignment of arms and
ammunition had been unloaded at a house in the village of Katarodai. a powerful patrol of 20
men that was deployed under Captain D R Sharma to investigate the accuracy of this report. The
patrol came under fire from a temple close to the suspected home, and after exchanging gunfire,
the patrol informed the battalion at Uduvil that the LTTE had taken control of the region and had
more members than had been previously estimated.
Major Parmeswaran, ‘A’ Company Commander came to the conclusion that a proper operation
would have to be launched and taking a strong patrol from his company proceeded at 2030 Hours
to reinforce Captain Sharma’s patrol. They arrived at the vicinity of the suspects around 0130
Hours on 25 November 1987. On seeing no movement except for an empty truck parked near the
house, they cordoned off the area and decided to carry out the search after first light.
On 25 November 1987, at 0530 Hours, the search got under way, but they turned up nothing.
Finally, they decided to move back. At this time the point section drew fire from the temple-
grove area which was effective and pinned it down. The party went to ground and returned the
fire. One person was killed and one person was injured in the initial hostile fire. While he and his
party took a detour from the west to go behind the LTTE and trap them in the temple-grove area,
Major Ramaswamy Parameswaran gave Captain D.R. Sharma instructions to keep the enemy
occupied and fixed by returning effective fire from the same place and to advance at the same
time by clearing the route house by house.When Captain Sharma began to advance, he received a lot of automatic fire from the coconut
and temple grove areas. His group cleared the homes to the west of the road and observed some
terrorists, who were shot and wounded, being dragged away by their comrades. In the meantime
Major Ramaswamy Parameswaran had reached behind the militants in the area of the coconut
grove and seeing the enemy he charged at them. The militants were using AK-47s, grenades,
explosives and the deadly Heavy Machine Guns (HMG) that inflicted heavy damage. The LTTE
had even mined the area that restricted the movement of the soldiers, who were totally at a
disadvantage. Maj Parameswaran quickly assessed the gravity of the situation and decided to
launch a counter-ambush to save his soldiers. He fought back ferociously and continued to
surround the militants, with no concern for his own safety. With cool presence of mind, he
encircled the militants from the rear and charged into them, taking them completely surprise.
During the hand-to-hand combat, a militant shot him in the chest. Undaunted, he snatched the
rifle from the militant and shot him dead. Despite being gravely wounded, he continued to give
directions to his troops and to inspire them till his end. The militants who by now sensed that
they had been trapped fought their way back and in the ensuing fighting both sides suffered
casualties. Reinforcements from the battalion had also arrived. The militants realising that they
would be defeated ran away into the jungle. Six enemy dead were confirmed, and three AK-47
rifles and two rocket launchers with bombs were recovered and the ambush was cleared.
For his cold courage, indomitable fighting spirit and supreme sacrifice, Major Ramaswamy
Parameswaran was given the nation’s highest gallantry award, ‘Param Vir Chakra’. He became
the first person from OTA Chennai to receive the prized PVC award, and the only one to receive
during OPERATION PAWAN, the IPKF in Sri Lanka.","Major Ramaswamy Parameswaran (IC-32907F) (Posthumous) 8 MAHAR

On 25 November 1987, when Major Ramaswamy Parameswaran was returning from search
operation in Sri Lanka, late at night, his column was ambushed by a group of militants. With
cool presence of mind, he encircled the militants from the rear and charged into them, taking
them completely surprise. During the hand-to-hand combat, a militant shot him in the chest.
Undaunted, Major Parameswaran snatched the rifle from the militant and shot him dead. Gravely
wounded, he continued to give orders and inspired his command till he breathed his last. Five
militants were killed and three rifles and two rocket launchers were recovered and the ambush
was cleared.
Major Ramaswamy Parameswaran displayed the most conspicuous gallantry and thought nothing
of dying at his post.

on 06 January 1949 to parents Amar Singh and Bholi Devi, in village Kadyal in Jammu. He hails
from an agricultural family and is the eldest of five brothers and three sisters. Coming from a
deeply religious family, developing a character and upholding integrity came naturally to him. An
extremely humble and down to earth person, when he was asked about his action which won him
the PVC, he simply said that anybody could have done it but somehow it fell to his lot to lead the
team.1 He joined the Indian Army on 06 January 1949 and was enrolled in the 8 JAK LI. He was
trained at the High-Altitude Warfare School in Gulmarg. Naib Subedar Bana Singh was tasked to
capture Quaid Post at Siachen which was located on a massive ice-mass at an altitude of 21,153
feet. He braved the rugged terrain and the Pakistani soldiers under inhospitable conditions and was
awarded the highest bravery award- Param Vir Chakra. On 23 January 2023 during the Parakram

India.Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (JAK LI) is an infantry regiment under the Indian Army. The
regimental history of JAK LI is very unique. In 1947, when Pakistani troops intruded into the
Indian territory, militia groups were raised from the locals of Jammu, Nubra and Leh under the
Indian ministry of Home Affairs. The militia fought with great distinction in the 1965 Indo-Pak
War. However, it was the gallant actions of the militia troop in the Indo-Pak War of 1971, that
earned them three battle honours. After the war in 1972, the militia was converted into a full-
fledged regiment and in 1976 the name was changed to Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry. The
JAK LI has been deployed in the Indian Peacekeeping Force in Sri Lanka in 1987 and also in the
United Nations Mission in Somalia. In 1984, JAK LI was deployed to the Siachen Glacier during
Op MEGHDOOT. 8 JAK LI earned great honour by capturing a Pakistani post at 21000 feet at the
Siachen Glacier in 1987.

The Siachen glacier is the second longest glacier in the world. The scroll of honour at Indian
Army’s Siachen base camp reads, “Quartered in snow, silent to remain. When the bugle calls,

that snatch away human lives if one is not careful. Given the vivacity of this glacier, it provided a

Karakoram Pass.3 Siachen area has been a bone of contention between Pakistan and India for many
years. The root cause of the issue can be traced back to the Karachi Agreement of 1949. The
representatives of both the nations drew the ‘Ceasefire Line’ across maps of Jammu and Kashmir
from Manawar in the South, to Khor in the North and thence ‘North to the glaciers’ through NJ
9842. Presumably when the discussion came up on the glaciated wilderness of snow and ice the
representatives stopped at grid point NJ 9842 on the presumption that neither side would be
interested in contesting an area where not a blade of grass grows and even breathing is a problem.
The problem started when Pakistan decided to explore their ambitions and complicated the issue.
They illegally ceded some 5180 square kilometers of Indian territory to China in the area where
the boundaries of India, Pakistan and China meet thereby altering the geo-strategic importance of
this area. Secondly, by permitting and assisting foreign mountaineering and scientific expeditions
in the area it raised the issue of ‘rights’ in an area that did not belong to them. The cartographic
ambiguities of 1962 and Pakistan’s growing devious nature had concerned the Indian Army and
in 1984 took pre-emptive action and occupied Saltoro Range.

The task of establishing Indian Army’s presence over Siachen Glacier was entrusted to one of the
Kumaon Battalions, supported by a company of Ladakh Scouts and two companies of another
Kumaon Battalion. Before undertaking the task, the Company Group carried out rigorous training
for several weeks, which included ice craft, snow craft, survival on snow and physical fitness and
mental robustness. The operation 'Meghdoot' was led by Maj (later Col) RS Sandhu, VrC. The

on Bilafond La (Siachen Glacier). The foot column led by Captain (later Lt Col) PV Yadav, SM,
reached the Glacier subsequently, after an extremely strenuous four-day march over extremely
inhospitable terrain. The column set up Camps I, II and III for maintenance of newly established
Posts on the Glacier. Companies of Kumaon Battalion were given responsibility for the security
of the line of communication of these posts.4 Op MEGHDOOT was executed in the morning of 13
April 1984 and pre-empted Pakistan’s impending Operation Ababeel. Indian soldiers managed to
control all major mountain passes of Sia La, Bilafond La and by 1987 Gyong La and all the
commanding heights of the Saltoro Ridge west of the Siachen Glacier.5
In 1987, Pakistan ordered their own troops to establish a post in Bilafond La in the Indian territory
which was named as Quaid Post after Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. In order to take
control of the post, India launched an operation codenamed Op RAJIV to capture the peak. The
operation was named after Second Lieutenant Rajiv Pandey who led a team of soldiers tasked to
capture a feature called Left Shoulder at 21000 feet lying between two Indian posts. During the
final assault on 29 May 1987, he was killed.6 Quaid Post was located on a massive ice mass located
at an altitude of 21,153 feet above sea level. The steep ice-wall of Quaid Post gives it a very
dominating position and to defend it one has to just take potshots at anyone trying to crawl up.
Naib Subedar Bana Singh volunteered to be a member of a task force constituted in June 1987.
He was joined by four others in this endeavour. While other members of the battalion engaged the
attention of Pakistani soldiers, Naib Subedar Singh and his team slowly climbed and clawed their
way up the steep wall of ice. The weather was extremely hostile and due to extreme cold the
weapons of the support group were malfunctioning.

managed to reach close to the enemy post. Enroute they crossed the frozen bodies of their comrades
from their battalion, who had been killed in earlier attempts to capture the post. Just short of the
objective Naib Subedar Singh further divided his small group and usin grenades rushed in. Lobbing
grenades into the bunkers and finishing off the occupants with the bayonet, seven Pakistani SSG

unit and the post was safe in Indian hands. He and his team were successful in capturing the Quaid

IC-57556H,Captain,Vikram Batra,13 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles Regiment,"Captain Vikram Batra, popularly remembered as the “Shershah of Kargil” was bom on 9
September 1974. He was the elder twin son of Girdhari Lal Batra and Kamal Batra from Palampur,
Himachal Pradesh. As a child, Captain Batra had always been inspired to join the forces. He
attended DAV College Chandigarh, where he had joined the National Cadet Corps (NCC). During
the inter-state NCC Camp, he was adjudged the best NCC Cadet Air Wing. He even attended and
marched at the Republic Day Parade. Later he informed his parents about his desire to join the
forces. He was commissioned into the Indian Army on 6 December 1997 in the 13 Jammu and
Kashmir Rifles (JAK RIF).
The Jammu and Kashmir Rifles has a unique regimental history. It was raised in 1821, by an
intrepid Indian ruler Gulab Singh. He was one of the ablest Generals of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and
later became the ruler of the Jammu and Kashmir state. As a state force, Jammu and Kashmir
Rifles fought as Imperial Service troops in both World War I and II and contributed immensely
during 1947-48 war. The Jammu and Kashmir Rifles was later absorbed into the Indian Army as
a distinct and separate regiment. In 1963, the designation was changed to Jammu and Kashmir
Rifles. After conversion, the Ladakh Scouts came under the aegis of the regiment and has only
recently acquired the title of a full-fledged regiment. During the Kargil conflict in 1999, the Jammu
and Kashmir Rifles created an unprecedented record of bravery and sacrifice.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and
Kashmir by any means. The Kargil war of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The war
commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the Pakistan army
surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is thought to be the
brain-child of General Pervez Musharraf, then chief of the Pakistan Army. On 3 May 1999,
intrusions were detected. On 26 May 1, the first air to ground strike was launched by the Indian
Airforce (IAF), followed by Operation Vijay, by the Indian Army to evict the intruders from the
Indian territory2. After two months of violent confrontation, the war came to an end on 26 July
1999.

This task was entrusted to the 13 JAK RIF. Lieutenant Colonel Yogesh Kumar Joshi decided to
employ the B and D Company under Captain SS Jamwal and Captain Vikram Batra respectively,
for the task. It was after the success at Point 5140 that Captain Batra delivered his iconic success
signal “Yeh Dil Mange More”. Captain Vikram Batra, was the D Company commander tasked
to capture Point 5140 on 20 June 1999. He reached close to the objective despite the treacherous
terrain. He along with his company moved from the East while maintaining absolute silence
achieving complete surprise. Captain Batra reorganised his column and displayed exemplary
leadership as he fought the enemy from the forefront. The officer’s action motivated his men to
physically attack the enemy positions. In an act of formidable courage, Captain Batra pounced
onto the enemy and killed four intruders in the physical combat.

and his company were tasked to clear enemy defences from a narrow feature with sharp cuttings
on both the sides leading up to Point 4875 and Area Ledge. Captain Batra led the assault from the
front and engaged with the enemy in a physical fight. He killed five enemy soldiers at point blank
range and he himself sustained serious injuries. Despite his injuries, he moved towards the next
enemy sangar and threw grenades to clear the enemy position. His dauntless determination inspired
his men to clear the enemy from a dominating position. Later, he succumbed to his injuries. His
fearless determination and leadership encouraged his company men to avenge his death and finally
capture Point 4875.
Captain Batra’s inspiring leadership, dedication to duty and steadfast love for his country continue
to be an inspiration to the young generation. He attended the call of duty with absolute disregard
of his personal safety. He was awarded the Param Vir Chakra (Posthumous).","Captain Vikram Batra (IC-57556), 13 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles, (Posthumous)
(Effective date of the Award: 07th July, 1999)
In Drass Sector, the enemy held strong fortified positions, heavily reinforced with automatic
weapons, with treacherous approaches dominating Srinagar-Leh Road, the lifeline of supplies to
Leh.
On 20 June 1999, Captain Vikram Batra, Commander Delta Company, was tasked to attack Pt
5140 during Operation VIJAY. Captain Vikram Batra, with his company, skirted around the
feature from the East and maintaining surprise reached within the assaulting distance. The officer
reorganized his column and motivated his men to physically assault the enemy positions. Leading
his men from the front, the officer in a daredevil assault pounced on the enemy and killed four
intruders in a hand-to-hand fight.
On 7 July 1999, in yet another operation in the area of Point 4875, the company of the officer was
tasked to clear a narrow feature with sharp cuttings on either side and heavily fortified enemy
defences, that covered the only approach to it.
In order to speed up the operation, the officer decided to assault the enemy positions along a narrow
ridge. Leading the assault, he engaged the enemy in a fierce hand-to-hand fight and killed five
enemy soldiers at point blank range. In this action, Captain Batra sustained grievous injuries.
Despite the serious injuries, he crawled towards the enemy and hurled grenades clearing the
position. Leading from the front he rallied his men and pressed on the attack and achieved a near
impossible military task in the face of heavy enemy fire with utter disregard for personal safety.
The officer, however, succumbed to his injuries. Inspired by this display of extraordinary junior
leadership, the troops fell upon the enemy with vengeance and annihilated them, finally capturing
Pt 4875.
Captain Vikram Batra, thus, displayed the most conspicuous personal bravery and junior
leadership of the highest order in the face of the enemy and made the supreme sacrifice in the
highest traditions of the Army.

IC-56959W,Captain,Manoj Kumar Pandey,1/11 Gorkha Rifles,"Lieutenant Manoj Kumar Pandey was bom on 25 June 1975 to Shri Gopi Chand Pandey and
Mohini Pandey. He was native of Rudha village, Kamlapur tehsil, Sitapur district. He was eldest
among his siblings. His early schooling took place at Sainik School, Lucknow. He was a brilliant
student in school. He always dreamt of adorning the uniform of the Indian Army. He wrote in his
personal diary, 'some goals are so worthy; it’s glorious even to fail’. After finishing his school
education, he joined the prestigious National Defence Academy (NDA), Khadakwasla to realise
his dream of becoming an army officer. After graduating, he joined the Indian Military Academy
(IMA), Dehradun to complete his final phase of training and was commissioned in the first
battalion of the 11 Gorkha Rifles (1/11 GR), a unit renowned for its heroic exploits. During the
Kargil conflict, Lieutenant Manoj Kumar Pandey was promoted to the rank of Captain.
The first battalion of Gurkha Regiment (now Gorkha Rifles) was raised in 1815 during the
Anglo-Nepalese war. Impressed by the qualities displayed by Gurkhas during the war, the British
started active recruitment of Gurkhas into the British Indian army. After the partition, in 1947
six Gurkha regiments viz , 1 GR, 3 GR, 4 GR, 5 GR, 8 GR and 9 GR remained with the Indian
Army , while 2 GR, 5 GR, 6 GR, 7 GR and 10 GR were transferred to British Army as part of
the Tripartite Agreement signed between India, Nepal and Britain. The 11 GR is the only Gorkha
Regiment raised in Independent India. It was raised on 1 January 1948. Since independence, the
regiment has participated in a number of wars and operations including the 1947 and 1971 wars
against Pakistan. The battalion’s motto is ‘Yatraham Vijay Statra’ (We are metaphors of
victory).
1/11 GR was deployed in Siachen Glacier when the Kargil war started. In summer of 1999
Pakistan army had surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army.
On 03 May 1999, intrusions were detected. On 25 May, the Government of India approved
application of Indian Airforce, followed by Operation Vijay, launched by the Indian Army to
evict the intruders from our territory. After two months of violent confrontation, the war came to
an end on 26 July 1999. One of the key battles which was fought during Op Vijay was in Batalik
sector. The Kalubhar Ridgeline dominates the Batalik Area. The Jubar Complex is to its left and
Point 5203 to its right in the Chorbat La Area, close to the LOC. The highest feature is Point
5287 (approximately 16,000 feet), with Point 4812 in its vicinity towards the south. The enemy
had occupied Kalubhar Ridgeline and it was important to evict the enemy to reclaim the lost
territory.1/11 GR was tasked to clear the Kalubhar Ridge. Lieutenant Manoj Kumar Pandey was Number
5 Platoon Commander. His platoon's mission was to eliminate the interfering enemy positions in
order to keep his battalion from being daylighted and being in a vulnerable position during its
advance to Kalubhar Ridge. As his platoon reached close to its objective on the night of
02/03 July 1999 it came under heavy persistent enemy fire from the surrounding heights. Under
heavy enemy fire, Lieutenant Manoj Kumar Pandey quickly manoeuvred his platoon to an
advantageous position and ordered one section of his platoon to clear enemy positions on the
right, while he cleared four hostile positions on the left. He attacked the first enemy position
fearlessly and killed two enemy personnel. Successively, he charged at the second position and
captured it by killing two more enemy personnel. While clearing the third position, Lieutenant
Manoj Kumar Pandey was hit in the shoulder and legs by enemy fire. Undaunted and
unconcerned about his serious wounds, he led the assault on the fourth position, rallying his men
and destroying it with a grenade. During this attack he got a fatal medium machine gun burst on
his forehead. It is this singular daredevil act of the officer, which provided the critical firm base
for the battalion to finally capture Khalubhar.

Lieutenant Manoj Kumar Pandey, a young officer of the 1/11 Gorkha Rifles, took part in a series
of boldly led attacks during Operation Vijay, forcing back the intruders with heavy losses in
Batalik including the capture of Jaubar Top.
His finest hour was during the advance to Khalubar, when he was Number 5 Platoon
Commander. On the night of 2/3 July 1999, as the platoon approached its final objective, it came
under heavy and intense enemy fire from the surrounding heights. The officer was tasked to clear
the interfering enemy positions, so as to prevent his battalion from getting day lighted, being in a
vulnerable position. The officer quickly moved his platoon to an advantageous position under
intense enemy fire and sent one section to clear the enemy positions from the right, while he
himself proceeded to clear four other enemy positions on the left. Fearlessly assaulting the first
enemy position, he killed two enemy personnel and proceeded to assault the second and
destroyed it by killing two more enemy personnel. Lieutenant Manoj Kumar Pandey was injured
on the shoulder and legs by enemy fire while clearing the third position. Undaunted and without
caring for his grievous injury, he led the assault on the fourth position urging his men and
destroyed the same with a grenade, even as he got a fatal Medium Machine Gun burst on his
forehead. It is this singular daredevil act of the officer, which provided the critical firm base for

bom on 03 March 1976 to Durga Ram and Bhag Devi. After completing his schooling in
Bilaspur, he moved to Delhi. On 26 June 1996, he joined the Indian Army and was posted to 13
Jammu and Kashmir Rifles (JAK RIF). He was awarded the Param Vir Chakra for his actions as
a leading scout of the attacking column at Point 4875 in Mushkoh Valley. In February 2022, he
was promoted to the rank of Subedar Major.
The Jammu and Kashmir Rifles has a rich regimental history. It was raised in 1821, by Gulab
Singh. He was one of the ablest Generals of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and later became the ruler of
the Jammu and Kashmir state. As a state force, Jammu and Kashmir Rifles fought as Imperial
Service troops in both World War I and II and contributed immensely during 1947-48 war. The
Jammu and Kashmir Rifles was later absorbed into the Indian Army as a distinct and separate
regiment. In 1963, the designation was changed to Jammu and Kashmir Rifles. After conversion,
the Ladakh Scouts came under the aegis of the regiment and has only recently acquired the title
of a full-fledged regiment. During the Kargil conflict in 1999, 13 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles had
an unprecedented record of bravery and sacrifice.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu
and Kashmir by any means. The Kargil war of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The
war commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the Pakistan
army surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is thought to
be the brain-child of General Pervez Musharraf, then chief of the Pakistan Army. On 3 May
1999, intrusions were detected. On 26 May 1, the first air to ground strike was launched by the
Indian Airforce (IAF), followed by Operation Vijay, by the Indian Army to evict the intruders
from the Indian territory2. After two months of violent confrontation, the war came to an end on
26 July 1999.
The capture of Tololing on 13 June 1999, changed the dynamics of the war. The next objectives
were to capture Point 5140 and Point 4875 as these features provided dominant viewpoints to the
National Highway 1 Alpha. The task was entrusted to the 13 JAK RIF. The main features of
Point 4875 include- Whale Back, Flat Top and Shivling. Lieutenant Colonel YK Joshi, the

despite the difficulties of fighting in treacherous terrain our troops were successful in seizing the

thereby stalling the column. Rifleman Sanjay Kumar, realising the gravity of the situation,
displayed indomitable spirit and unadulterated courage when he charged the enemy Sangar with
utter disregard to personal safety. In the ensuing hand to hand combat, he killed three of the

Uttar Pradesh. He completed his primary education at a village school and after Class V, went on
to join Sannota Sri Krishna College in Bulandshahr. His father, Ram Karan Smgh had served
with 11 KUMAON as a soldier and had played an active role in the India-Pakistan Wars of 1965
and 1971. As Yogendra and his brother grew up, listening to the fascinating stories of valour and
courage narrated by their father, they harboured dreams of joining the Army. His elder brother,
Jitendra Singh Yadav was also recruited into the Indian Army in the Artillery regiment.
Yogendra belonged to a blood line where bravery was ingrained and was destined to follow in
the footsteps of his father and brother He was recruited into the Grenadiers Regiment on 27
December 1999 at the age of 16.
During the Kargil war of 1999, the Pakistani intruders had surreptitiously occupied positions on
Tiger Hill complex besides other winter vacated posts. Point 5062, named the Tiger Hill at
16,608 feet was one of the most important objectives during Op Vijay. It is one of the most
dominating and awe-inspiring features in the Dras sector. Tiger Hill was the pivotal post around
which the intruders’ defences were based. Occupation of Tiger Hill facilitated the enemy with a
commanding view of the Srinagar-Leh National Highway 1A. Firmly entrenched on Tiger Hill
complex, enemy could effectively interdict vehicular movement with observed artillery fire, thus
seriously interfering with the lifeline of the Ladakh region .
18 GRENADIERS, which had already lost two valiant officers, Lt. Col R. Viswanathan and
Major Rajesh Smgh Adhikari during Tololing Operations, was given the near impossible task of
capturing the Tiger Hill on the night of 3/4 July 1999. 8 SIKH, which was occupying dominating
heights around the South-Eastern and Northern part of Tiger Hill, was tasked to provide the firm
base. At 1900 hours, the multi-direction attacks began in freezing rain, commencing with a
nearly 12-hour vertical climb from Southern and North - Eastern approach using fixed ropes.
Lt Balwan Singh led the Ghatak Platoon of 18 GRENADIERS from the dangerous North­
Eastern approach. Grenadier Yogendra Smgh Yadav was the lead Ghatak. He had eagerly
volunteered to lead the attack. To reach the objective his team had to fix the ropes on the cliff
face for his platoon to climb. As his leading team climbed to reach enemy position, heavy fire
from the enemy fatally wounded his Team Commander and two teammates and almost stalled
the advance. Grenadier Yogendra was also severely wounded, but knowing the gravity of the
situation he continued to climb towards the enemy positions. He crawled towards the enemy
position but sustained multiple bullet injuries.# f :% - f wnfcnera

critical condition. This heroic deed of Grenadier Yogendra Singh Yadav motivated his platoon to
capture Tiger Hill Top and thus the vital objective was achieved. This decisive victory sealed the
fate of Pakistan’s Kargil misadventure.

CITATION
Grenadier Yogendra Singh Yadav (2690572), 18 Grenadiers
Grenadier Yogendra Singh Yadav was part of the leading team of Ghatak Platoon tasked to
capture Tiger Hill on the night of 03/04 July 1999. The approach to the top, at a height of 16,500
feet, was steep, snow bound and rocky. He volunteered to be in the lead and fixed rope for his
team to climb up, unmindful of the risk involved.
The enemy, on seeing his team approach the area top, opened intense automatic, grenade, rocket
and artillery fire. His team commander and two of his colleagues fell to murderous enemy fire.
The further advance of Ghatak Platoon was stalled. Knowing the gravity of the situation, he

At the age of 17 years Havildar Bachittar Singh, joined the Army and was enrolled in the Sikh
Regiment on 10 January 1937. The SIKH Regiment is one of the highest decorated regiments
of the Indian Army. It came into existence on 01 August 1846, with the raising of the Regiment
of Ferozepore Sikhs and Regiment of Ludhiana Sikhs by Captain G Tebbs and Lieutenant
Colonel P Gordon respectively. They participated effectively in the 1857 First War of
Independence. This war revealed the valour and fighting tenacity of the Sikh soldiers. They
soon earned a rank of seniority over other Indian Sepoys. Under the British Indian Army, the
Sikh Regiment fought gallantly in a number of wars and battles including the Battle of
Saragarhi in which they left an indelible mark in the Regiment’s history. By 1914 the SikhRegiment was deployed as part of the British Indian Army for operations in World War I. The
Regiment served in all theatres of operations and earned 28 battle honours. The modern Sikh
Regiment traces its roots directly to the 11th Sikh Regiment of the British Indian Army. When
transferred to the Indian Army post-independence, the numeral 11 was removed and new
battalions were added. 1 SIKH was later mechanised in 1970 and re-designated as 4

The MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY was formed as the 103rd Mahrattas in 1768, making it
the senior most light infantry regiment of the Army. Their Regimental Centre has been
Belgaum, Karnataka, since 1922. The battle cry of the MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY is,

the Maratha Emperor Shivaji. Indian independence saw the Regiment reverting back to the
original five battalions, with the 3 MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY converting to the airborne
role and becoming 2 PARA in April 1952. With the integration of the erstwhile Princely States,
the 19th, 20th, 22nd battalions were amalgamated, from the State Forces of Kolhapur, Baroda,
and Hyderabad, with the Regiment. The expansion of the Indian Army to meet the omnipresent
threat to its borders has seen the Regiment grow to its present total of 18 battalions and two
TA battalions whilst the period also saw the conversion of 21st Bn into 21 Para (Special Forces)
and the 115 Infantry battalion (TA) being grouped under the MAHAR Regiment. The five

(IC-5261) CAPTAIN MAN BAHADUR RAI, 1/11 GORKHA RIFLES
(Effective date of award — 03 May 1961)
In April–May 1961, Captain Man Bahadur Rai (IC-5261) took part in a series of actions against
a body of hostile Nagas who had entrenched themselves in a very difficult, densely wooded,
hilly region interspersed with numerous ravines. Towards the end of April 1961, he led a
platoon at dead of night through two hostile positions into the heart of their stronghold, fiercely
attacked them and was successful in dislodging them from that position. On the 3rd May 1961,
he led a platoon against another strongly fortified hostile position which was situated on the
steep slopes of a ravine.
This position dominated the surrounding area and could not be approached except frontally.
Captain Rai, knowing that heavy casualties would result if he were to attack frontally, took half
a platoon, crawled through the thick undergrowth and scaled up the steep side while exposed
to a hail of close-range fire which covered his advance. On locating the hostile position, he
pressed forward in its direction, threw two hand grenades killing a few hostiles and charged
the position firing as he went and killing two more hostiles.
This fearless and unexpected assault spurred his men to action and so demoralised the hostiles
that they fled into the thick jungle. The hostiles lost ten men in the encounter and left behind
two rifles, one 12 bore gun and one tommy gun. The attack dealt a crushing blow to the hostiles
and led to the eventual destruction of their position.
This action was one of several in which Captain Rai took part, first as an officer of the 8th
Battalion of the Assam Rifles and more recently as an officer of the Village Guards
Organisation of Nagaland. Throughout this period, he repeatedly showed conspicuous bravery,
unselfishness and indomitable courage in very difficult and dangerous situations. His leader-
ship and unconquerable will have been a source of inspiration to all his comrades and are in
the highest traditions of the Army.

The year 1984 witnessed a rapid growth in separatist movement and the escalating militancy
in Punjab region. Operation Blue Star is a controversial military action against militant
Khalistan separatists who barricaded themselves in the Sikh's shrine the Golden Temple in
Punjab. Operation Bluestar aimed to flush out Sikh militants who had taken refuge inside theGolden Temple complex in the first week of June 1984. Lieutenant General Sundarji assisted
then Chief of Army Staff General Vaidya in planning and coordinating Operation Bluestar.
Major General (later Lieutenant General) Kuldip Singh Brar was commanding the troops
responsible for flushing out the separatists from the Golden Temple.1 The main objective of
the Operation Bluestar was to remove Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the leader of the Sikh
extremist group ‘Damdami Taksal’, and his armed followers from the Golden Temple complex.
The complex had become a stronghold for militants who had amassed a large ammunition and
weapons and turned it into a fortified position. Under the command of General Kuldip Singh
Brar, the Indian Army launched the operation on 03 June, 1984. The operation involved a
significant deployment of troops and heavy artillery, with the aim of neutralizing the militants
while minimizing civilian casualties and damage to the sacred shrine. 15 KUMAON was one
of the units deployed in Amritsar to be a part of Operation Bluestar. Major Bhukant Misra was
commanding a Company of the Battalion which was tasked to clear the terrorists from a heavily
fortified building of the Golden Temple Complex.

The year 1984 witnessed a rapid growth in separatist movement and the escalating militancy
in Punjab region. Operation Blue Star is a controversial military action against militant
Khalistan separatists who barricaded themselves in the Sikh's shrine the Golden Temple in
Punjab. Operation Bluestar aimed to flush out Sikh militants who had taken refuge inside the
Golden Temple complex in the first week of June 1984. Lieutenant General Sundarji the
Western Army Commander assisted then Chief of Army Staff General Vaidya in planning and
coordinating Operation Bluestar. Major General (later Lieutenant General) Kuldip Singh Brar
was commanding the troops responsible for flushing out the separatists from the Golden
Temple.1 The main objective of the Operation Bluestar was to remove Jarnail Singh
Bhindranwale, the leader of the Sikh extremist group ‘Damdami Taksal’, and his armed
followers from the Golden Temple complex. The complex had become a stronghold for
militants who had amassed a large ammunition and weapons and turned it into a fortified
position. Under the command of General Kuldip Singh Brar, the Indian Army launched the
operation on 03 June, 1984. The operation involved a significant deployment of troops and
heavy artillery, with the aim of neutralizing the militants while minimizing civilian casualties
and damage to the sacred shrine. 15 KUMAON was one of the units deployed in Amritsar to
be a part of Operation Bluestar. Major Bhukant Misra was commanding a Company of the
Battalion which was tasked to clear the terrorists from a heavily fortified building of the Golden
Temple Complex.

he used to don his grandfather's or father's uniform, complete with the Gorkha Hat and pretend
to be an officer. As a child, he used to mix very freely with the Gorkha jawans of his father's
unit and could speak fluent Gorkhali. He was dearly loved by the jawans or 'Dajus', meaning
elder brother, as he addressed them and to whom he was known as their favourite 'naani',
meaning little one.

(NSG) Course, and Staff College and ultimately to command the 1/11 GORKHA RIFLES to
which his father belonged. He also aspired to be awarded with the Chief of the Army Staff's
commendation and a gallantry award while as a Captain. Secondly, he wanted to use his
knowledge and training by single mindedly involving himself in complete eradication of
militant forces and influences working against the interest and integrity of the nation for which
he had dedicated his life. He had adopted the motto 'Death Before Dishonour'. In 1997, 1/11

The first Battalion of Gurkha Regiment (now Gorkha Rifles) was raised in 1815 during the
Anglo-Nepalese war. Impressed by the qualities displayed by Gurkhas during the war, the
British started active recruitment of Gurkhas into the British Indian army. After the partition,
in 1947 six Gurkha regiments viz, 1 GR, 3 GR, 4 GR, 5 GR, 8 GR and 9 GR remained with the
Indian Army, while 2 GR, 5 GR, 6 GR, 7 GR and 10 GR were transferred to British Army as
part of the Tripartite Agreement signed between India, Nepal and Britain. The 11 GR is the
only Gurkha Regiment raised in Independent India. It was raised on 01 January 1948. Since
independence, the regiment has participated in a number of wars and operations including the
1947 and 1971 wars against Pakistan and insurgency operation along the ravines of Nagaland.
The battalion’s motto is ‘Yatraham Vijay Statra’ (We are metaphors of victory). 1/11 GR was
deployed in Siachen Glacier when the Kargil war started. Pakistan army had surreptitiously
occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. The contribution of 1/11 GORKHARIFLES during Operation VIJAY 1999 remains etched in the history of Indian Army. 1/11
GORKHA RIFLES fought in multiple key battles fought during Op Vijay in Batalik sector. A
young officer Captain Manoj Kumar Pandey of 1/11 GORKHA RIFLES was awarded Param
Vir Chakra for his supreme sacrifice during the Kargil War. For the display of prowess in
warfare the unit also received CAOS Unit","for Operation Vijay 1999. The Regiment
has also given India its first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, PVSM UYSM
AVSM, YSM, SM, VSM, ADC. He was succeeded by General Anil Chauhan, PVSM, UYSM,
AVSM, SM, VSM who adds on to the Regiment’s legacy of shaping the extraordinary leaders.
On 19 July 1997, 1/11 GORKHA RIFLES received information that a group of mercenaries
was holed up in a house in the Naushera locality of Soura. Second Lieutenant Puneet Nath Datt
was ordered to lead his Company in the search operation and eliminate the militants. Second
Lieutenant Datt decided to begin the search from a suspicious-looking three-storeyed house.
He tried to flush out the mercenaries by throwing stones at the doors and windows of the house.
Then a soldier was asked to fire at the third floor of the house. That provoked the militants to
fire back, thus confirming their presence in the locked house. In the three hours encounter that
followed, the fearless young officer kept taking pot-shots at the windows and lobbing hand
grenades into the solidly-built house. But to no avail. Suddenly a militant was spotted trying to
fire at the soldiers from the first-floor balcony of the house. Second Lieutenant Datt killed the
militant by firing a snap burst at him from his AK-47 rifle.
The only option for the Company now was to blast its way into the house. This was not an easy
job. Whoever went to place the charge in the house would be vulnerable to both the bullets of
the militants and the explosion from the charge. Second Lieutenant Puneet Nath Datt insisted
on taking up the task. The moment he jumped over the wall of the house, he ran into a militant
trying to make a dash for freedom. Second Lieutenant Datt swung his AK-47 up and shot him
dead. Thereafter he placed the charge, jumped back the boundary wall and set off the blast.
Then, he and another officer took turns at tossing grenades at the first floor from where the last
surviving militant was firing at them. The militant spotted Second Lieutenant Datt and fired at
him. But at that very moment, Second Lieutenant Datt too spotted him and let off a burst that
killed the militant. But the militant also fired at him. There was blood in his mouth and he was
evacuated to the hospital. A few hours later, he passed away. The bullet fired by the militant
had hit him in the mouth and exited a little below his ear. Second Lieutenant Puneet Nath Datt
displayed courage and valour of the highest order and laid down his life for the country. He
was awarded the Ashoka Chakra posthumously. The award was received by his mother, Mrs
Anita Dutt.CITATION
SECOND LIEUTENANT PUNEET NATH DATT (IC-53987), 1/11 GORKHA RIFLES
(POSTHUMOUS) 20 July, 1997

launched an operation in Srinagar based on hard intelligence based on hard intelligence
gathered by Second Lieutenant Puneet Nath Datt.
A group of foreign militants had fortified themselves in a three storied almost impregnable
house with a high compound wall all round which dominated the area and afforded an in an
all-round excellent field of fire.
On being surrounded by troops led by Second Lieutenant Puneet Nath Datt militants brought
down heavy fire troops. The militants skilfully used the house and the protection if afforded to
thwart all the attempts by own troops, until Second Lieutenant Puneet Nath Datt unmindful of
his personal safety and undaunted by the heavy militant fire leaned across the boundary wall,
charged through a hail of bullets placed and exploded pole charges creating a way into the
house.
A militant at that instant charged through the opening bringing down effective fire on own
troops. Seeing this Second Lieutenant Puneet Nath Datt bounced out of the cover, eliminating
the militant burst of AK fire.
An immense exchange of fire ensued and militants opened a point of exit at the rear of the
house. Second Lieutenant Puneet Nath Datt realising the some of the trapped militants were
attempting to escape. He quickly adjusted his position with tactical acumen as well as combat
tenacity and placed himself in the escape route. The militants realising hopeless situation
charged out of the house, firing incessantly. Second Lieutenant Puneet Nath Datt in a dazzling
gallant move lobbed a grenade through the window killing the third militant. This also caused
an explosion of huge quantity of explosive and ammunition stashed in the house bringing it
down.
The officer had by now killed three hardcore foreign militants singlehandedly and destroyed a
well-fortified hideout. He finally succumbed to his grievous injuries sustained by him on 20
July 1997 at 1215 Hours.
Second Lieutenant Puneet Nath Datt thus displayed most conspicuous act of bravery,
exemplary leadership and supreme sacrifice in the highest tradition of Indian Army

The Parachute Regiment is an airborne and special forces regiment of the Indian Army. It was
raised in 1945 as part of the British Indian Army but was disbanded after the World War II and
was re-raised in 1952 by absorbing the three existing parachute battalions of the 50th Parachute
Brigade. In the post-independence restructuring, India retained only one Parachute Brigade—
the 50th. This brigade consisted of three distinguished battalions personally nominated by the
then Commander-in-Chief, namely 1 PARA (PUNJAB), 2 PARA (MARATHA) and 3 PARA
(KUMAON). During the Jammu and Kashmir operations of 1947-48 these battalions
distinguished themselves with glory in the battles of Shelatang, Naushera, Jhangar and Poonch,
and were awarded the respective Battle Honours. On 15 April 1952, the three battalions serving
with the Parachute Brigade were removed from their respective Infantry Regiments to form the
PARACHUTE REGIMENT. Since then, The Regiment has participated in 1962 War, 1971
War, Op PAWAN, Op CACTUS, and 1999 Kargil War. Currently it comprises seven Special
Forces, six Airborne, two Territorial Army and one Rashtriya Rifles Battalions. The 9 PARA
(SF) was raised in 1966 as 9th Parachute Commando Battalion. The three of the Special Forces
battalions were originally trained for use in certain environments; 1 PARA (SF) [Strategic
Reserve], 9 PARA (SF) [Mountain], 10 PARA (SF) [Desert] and 21 PARA (SF) [Jungle].
Currently, all the Special Forces battalions are trained for all environments.In Kashmir, the Special Forces operators of Indian Army often roamed in militant disguise,
hunting for terrorists by locating their hideouts. This strategy facilitated the execution of many
militants, their leader and even eliminated several outfits. In July 1993, in an operation in Kandi
village, located in Budhal tehsil of Rajouri district, Major Walia eliminated three hard core
terrorists. On 26 Jan 1993, he was awarded Sena Medal for his display of gallantry,
commendable courage, leadership and devotion to duty during this operation. In the year 1994,

and sent his most fearless and valiant soldier to the battle area of Kargil. Within ten days of
his departure from Delhi, he led his team to capture Zulu Top at 5200 metres, in the Mushkoh
Valley sector.

Following the victory of Kargil War, on 29 August 1999 at 0830 hours, Major Sudhir Kumar
led a Squad of five men into the dense undergrowth in Haphruda forest in Kupwara District of
Jammu and Kashmir. Soon he heard voices of militants but was unable to see them. He, along
with his buddy crawled uphill and on reaching a knoll, observed two armed militants barely
four metres ahead, and a large covered hideout in a depression 15 metres below. The officer
immediately fired killing the closest sentry and charged at the second, who jumped back
towards the hideout. Major Sudhir Kumar without hesitation charged at the hideout with only
his buddy giving him covering fire. The militants who out numbered about twenty were
shocked and rushed out in an attempt to flee. The officer single handedly grappled with them
and firing from a distance of two metres, killed four militants. In this action, he was, however,
hit on his face, chest and arm and fell down bleeding profusely at the entrance to the hideout
Major Sudhir Kumar, although unable to move, called up his troop commanders and all the
stops on the radio set and directed them to hold fast and not to allow the rest of the militants toescape. It was only after 35 minutes, when the fire fight stopped that he permitted his
evacuation.
Bleeding profusely, he continued to pass instructions to his troops on his radio set. He passed
away holding his set.
Major Sudhir Kumar, thus, displayed most conspicuous gallantry and bravery beyond compare
and made the supreme sacrifice in the highest traditions of the Indian Army.

IC- 61417,Lieutenant,Triveni Singh,(5 JAK LI),"Lieutenant Triveni Singh was born on 01 February 1978, to Captain Janmej Singh Thakur and
Mrs. Pushplata in Ranchi, Jharkhand. He originally hailed from Pathankot, Punjab. His father
served in the Indian Army and retired as a Captain. Lieutenant Triveni Singh completed his
schooling from St Joseph Convent School Pathankot and went to Ludhiana for his graduation.
He was proficient in martial arts and went on to become a National Level champion in Karate
and Swimming. After graduating from the Punjab Agriculture University, Ludhiana, he joined
the Indian Military Academy in Dehradun and passed out on 08 Dec 2001 as a proud
Lieutenant. He was commissioned into 5 JAMMU AND KASHMIR LIGHT INFANTRY at
the age of 23.

He was then sent for further training, Young Officers Basic Course and Commando Course,
to the Infantry School in Mhow, Indore, Madhya Pradesh and Junior Leaders Wing in Belgaum,
Karnataka. He was awarded the nation’s highest peace time gallantry award, the Ashoka
Chakra (AC) posthumously on 26 January 2004 for his selfless act of extraordinary gallantry,
unyielding fighting spirit and supreme sacrifice on 02 January 2004 against a terrorist attack at
a railway station in Jammu. His proud father Captain Janmej Singh Thakur received the Ashoka
Chakra from then President of India Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam on his son’s behalf. He is survived
by his father, mother and two sisters Pooja and Jyotsana.
Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (JAK LI) is an infantry regiment of the Indian Army. The
regimental history of JAK LI is very unique. In 1947, when Pakistani troops intruded into the
Indian territory, militia groups were raised from the locals of Jammu, Nubra and Leh under the
Ministry of Home Affairs. The militia fought with great distinction in the 1965 India-Pakistan
War. However, it was the gallant action of the militia troops in the India-Pakistan War of 1971
that earned them three battle honours. After the war in 1972, the militia was converted into a
full-fledged regiment and in 1976 the name was changed to Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry.
The JAK LI has been deployed in the Indian Peacekeeping Force in Sri Lanka in 1987 and also
in the United Nations Mission in Somalia.It also has a distinguished record in Siachen. SubedarMajor and Honorary Captain Bana Singh who was awarded the Param Vir Chakra belongs to
this Regiment.
In 2003, Lieutenant Triveni Singh’s unit, 5 JAK LI was deployed in Jammu and he was
appointed as the Adjutant of the unit. Since being commissioned into the unit, Lieutenant Singh
had participated in several major operations in Jammu and Kashmir. One such operation
involved hunting down two terrorists who had attacked a Dogra battalion’s Barrack on 28 June
2003 injuring one officer, six soldiers, and twelve others. During the said operation, he chased
the second terrorist across a field before killing him.
On 02 January 2004 at 18:50 hours, two heavily armed terrorists entered the Jammu Railway
Station and started firing indiscriminately at the passengers, killing three and injuring fifteen.
On receiving information about the fidayeen attack, the Commanding Officer asked Lieutenant
Triveni Singh, who was the Adjutant of his unit, to alert the officers and soldiers on duty and
prepare for action. Realising the gravity and urgency of the situation and believing that
informing and collecting everyone would delay the operation, Lieutenant Singh requested the
Commanding Officer that he be allowed to lead a Quick Reaction Team to the railway station.
After being granted the permission, Lieutenant Triveni Singh and his team of commandos
quickly got into a jeep and Lieutenant Singh asked the driver to speed across the railway tracks
in order to reach the under-siege station faster. Despite this, by the time Lieutenant Triveni
Singh reached the station, the number of casualties had increased to seven while several others
had been injured. Without wasting any time, Lieutenant Triveni Singh immediately swung into
action and ordered his troops to cordon off the station. At 19:25 hours, Lieutenant Singh along
with his team and a police party began a search of the Railway Station, aimed at locating and
identifying the terrorists. As a result, in order to avoid detection, the terrorists reduced their fire
and became untraceable.
At 22:20 hours, as the officers were regrouping, one of the terrorists hiding under the staircase
of the overhead bridge, opened fire and injured a policeman. Moving swiftly, Lieutenant Singh
spotted the terrorist and closed in on him before the terrorist could reach the exit gate of the
station and killed him instantly. According to an eyewitness, a senior railway police officer,
Singh and his team reached the spot in ten minutes, cordoned off the station and employed the
‘zigzag methodology’ to arrive within close range of the terrorists. Singh took on the terrorists
in a gunfight at close quarters. He faced indiscriminate firing and lobbing of grenades. He
succeeded in killing one of them near the bridge between the first and the second platforms,
and took charge of the so far uncontrollable situation.
However, the second terrorist now began firing from the overhead rail bridge and lobbed a
grenade at Lieutenant Triveni Singh in an attempt to escape. In this exchange of fire Lieutenant
Singh sustained a bullet injury to the lower part of his face, an injury which would later prove
fatal. Despite his injuries, he remained aware of the fact that the terrorist was equipped with
lethal weapons and had enough ammunition to kill over 300 passengers that had taken refuge
in the parcel room, a short distance away. Lieutenant Triveni Singh charged, closing the
distance between himself and the terrorist quickly, grappled and engaged him in hand-to-handcombat before killing him at close quarters and succumbed to his injuries. His body was found
six inches away from the terrorist he had just killed.
In the exchange of fire between the two sides, that continued for almost two and a half hours,
seven people were killed, including Lieutenant Triveni Singh, one Police Officer, two BSF
Jawans, one Railway Policeman and two Civilians while fifteen others were injured in the
attack. Additionally, a huge cache of AK-47 magazines and grenades was recovered from the
terrorist. Lieutenant Triveni Singh’s body was taken to his hometown, Pathankot in Punjab,
where his funeral was conducted with full military honour. In this exemplary display of bravery
and courage of exceptional order, Lieutenant Triveni Singh killed both the terrorists single-
handedly, thereby preventing a bloodbath and saving the lives of many innocent civilians
stranded at the Jammu Railway Station. His last words were “Mission accomplished, Sir”.
Maj Gen Rajinder Singh, General Officer Commanding (GOC), 26 Infantry Division in
Jammu, said after the operation, that Lieutenant Triveni Singh was a brave and sharp boy even
when he was commissioned in the 5 JAMMU AND KASHMIR LIGHT INFANTRY back in
2001. He also said that, “I am proud of our young officer Lieutenant Triveni Singh, who braved
firing and grenade bursts to kill both the suicide group terrorists in the shortest-ever operation
at the railway station”.
Lieutenant. Triveni Singh was posthumously awarded the Ashok Chakra, the country's highest
bravery award during peacetime for displaying conspicuous gallantry. President APJ Abdul
Kalam presented the award to Lieutenant Triveni Singh's father, Captain Janmej Singh
(Retired) during the 2004 Republic Day parade.
Lieutenant Triveni Singh’s mother, Mrs. Pushpalata remembers him as a miracle that came into
their lives. She remembers the day he was born and mentions that the doctor had congratulated
her for having given birth to an officer of the Indian Army.
“Let every mother give birth to children like Triveni who refuse to abandon their guns and
run away from the battlefield even if their decision costs them their life”
– Mrs Pushpalta, MotherCaptain Janmej Singh and Mrs Pushpalata unveiled a statue of their son Lieutenant Triveni
Singh at the Sunjuwan Military Station.

Lieutenant Triveni Singh’s father, Captain Janmej Singh who is an Army veteran himself
reminisces that, seeing his father in a uniform all his life, is probably what inspired Triveni
Singh to join the army. His sister, Jyotsana, remembers asking her “Sonu Bhayiya”, as she
endearingly called him, how he was coping with the ‘difficult training’ he was having to go
through at the Academy. He replied that he wasn’t finding it difficult at all, instead he found it
an interesting exercise in testing himself to his limits which he hadn’t found yet. His eldest
sister, Pooja, fondly remembers having once asked him what gift he wanted, and he had replied
with “a Combat Kit”.
His family still remembers the day they last saw him like it was yesterday. He had come home
on 31st December 2003 to celebrate the New Year with them and they had had a great time
together. However, he had to go back on 01 January 2004 and asked his mother to wake him
up early in the morning. His father now remembers seeing off his beloved son that day, unaware
that that would be the last time he would see him alive.
“I am proud, but at the same time I am sad. He has done well for the country and saved
hundreds of lives. I am sad because he is not with me when I am in the evening of my life.
I am a very proud father. His memory will take us along”

Captain Singh recalls the sequence of events of that fateful day, on the night of 02 January
2004, the family was sitting and planning Triveni Singh’s wedding, which was to take place in
two months’ time. Captain Singh received a phone call from his son’s in-laws, asking him to
turn on the news. He turned on the television and began surfing through channels airing reports
of a terrorist attack on the Jammu Railway Station. The station was filled with hundreds of
people and security personnel. He continued to watch the reports on the operations being
undertaken, first by the police and then by the paramilitary forces to take out two heavily armed
Lashkar-e-Tayiba terrorists. “After a while, I noticed a headline scrolling at the bottom of the
screen”, he recalls. It said an Army officer had been killed in the operation. “Then they put out
a flash naming the officer; it was my son, Lieutenant Triveni Singh '' and his heart sank. But
he still hoped that his son was fine, despite being aware that his son was the only Triveni Singh
in the Army from that area, “In my mind, I knew my son was dead. But I did not tell anyone”.
So, he called up the base where his son was posted, “the officer at the other end said Triveni
was all right. But I insisted on speaking to his superior.”
He further added, “The media does not lie”. On being told that the superior officers were at the
Railway Station, he decided to go there and find out for himself. On reaching the base, they
were informed of their son’s brave actions that had saved over 1000 lives and made the 25-
year-old a hero in the eyes of all those who witnessed that unbelievable feat. Captain Janmej
Singh then went to the Railway Station and saw, with his own eyes, the location where his sonhad fought and saved so many lives, but had failed to save his own. He says, “there was not
one spot on that station that wasn’t covered with bullet holes” and it made him wonder, “how
can someone come out alive from such an onslaught of bullets”. “It is his reaction to any
situation that reveals the mettle of a man. There were hundreds of people from all communities
at the Jammu Railway Station. How you reach the place and how you achieve your target
decides the number of innocent people who will live or die. Within fifteen seconds of beginning
the operation, Triveni had achieved his target” said the proud father about his son’s brave
actions and sacrifice as Lieutenant Singh left the anonymity of his military uniform behind and
added his name in golden letters to the heroic annals of India’s fight against terrorism.","IC-61417 LIEUTENANT TRIVENI SINGH

The Parachute Regiment is an airborne and special forces regiment of the Indian Army. It was
raised in 1945 as part of the British Indian Army but was disbanded after the World War II and
was re-raised in 1952 by absorbing the three existing parachute battalions of the 50th Parachute
Brigade. In the post-independence restructuring, India retained only one Parachute Brigade—
the 50th. This brigade consisted of three distinguished battalions personally nominated by thethen Commander-in-Chief, namely 1 PARA (PUNJAB), 2 PARA (MARATHA) and 3 PARA
(KUMAON). During the Jammu and Kashmir operations of 1947-48 these battalions
distinguished themselves with glory in the battles of Shelatang, Naushera, Jhangar and Poonch,
and were awarded the respective Battle Honours. On 15 April 1952, the three battalions serving
with the Parachute Brigade were removed from their respective Infantry Regiments to form the
PARACHUTE REGIMENT. Since then, The Regiment has participated in 1962 War, 1971
War, Op PAWAN, Op CACTUS, and 1999 Kargil War. Currently it comprises seven Special

PARA (SF) [Mountains], 10 PARA (SF) [Deserts] and 21 PARA (SF) [Jungles]. Currently, all
the Special Forces Battalions are trained for all environments.

Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (JAK LI) is an Infantry Regiment under the Indian Army.
The Regimental history of JAK LI is very unique. In 1947, when Pakistani troops intruded
into the Indian territory, militia groups were raised from the locals of Jammu, Nubra and Leh
under the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs. The militia fought with great distinction in the
1965 Indo-Pak War. However, it was the gallant actions of the militia troop in the Indo-Pak
War of 1971, that earned them three battle honours. After the war in 1972, the militia was
converted into a full-fledged Regiment and in 1976 the name was changed to Jammu andKashmir Light Infantry. The JAK LI has been deployed in the Indian Peacekeeping Force in
Sri Lanka in 1987 and also in the United Nations Mission in Somalia. In 1984, JAK LI was
deployed to the Siachen Glacier during Op MEGHDOOT. 8 JAK LI earned great honour by
capturing a Pakistani post at 21000 feet at the Siachen Glacier in 1987. Subedar Bana Singh
of this Regiment has been awarded the Param Vir Chakra.
On 24 August 2000, Havildar Chuni Lal was part of a special mission operation at the Line
of Control in Doda- Poonch Sector in Jammu and Kashmir, where he successfully thwarted
enemy's attack to capture own Forward Post. On the night of 23/24 August 2000, when enemy
started shelling and firing heavily at own Post, despite heavy shelling, Havildar Chuni Lal
displayed undaunted bravery by moving from bunker-to-bunker within his Section motivating
his troops who brought down effective Medium Machine Gun fire on the enemy's attacking
column. Subsequently, he inspired his men by personal example to fight a close quarter battle
in open trenches. Observing that two enemy soldiers had jumped inside own communication
trench, he picked up a Light Machine Gun and rushed at them disregarding own safety and shot
them dead. Taken by surprise at the ferocity of the pro-active stance of own troops, the enemy
quickly retreated leaving behind several weapons at our Post. Twelve enemy soldiers were
killed in the action. Havildar Chuni Lal displayed conspicuous courage and relentless offensive
action in the face of the enemy. For his gallantry he was awarded Vir Chakra.
Earning the name of being an extraordinary soldier at a very young age only inspired Naib
Subedar Chuni Lal to outdo himself with every new opportunity which came his way. In the
year 2007 he was posted in Kupwara District of Jammu and Kashmir. On the night of 24 June,
the troops of his unit noticed some suspicious movements along the line of control. Due to poor
visibility, the movement of the terrorists could not be tracked effectively.Naib Subedar Chuni Lal's wife receiving Ashok Chakra award from the President Pratibha

group of terrorists hiding near the line of control. Naib Subedar Chuni Lal retaliated
immediately with heavy volume of fire. The young JCO putting his acumen into the act
manoeuvred his troops to block all escape routes of the terrorists. This led to the elimination of
two fleeing terrorists at the outset, the remaining terrorists finding themselves surrounded and

Karnataka. Due to his father’s transferable job, he studied in a number of schools in various
places including Udupi, Shimoga and Bangalore. He graduated from MES College, Bangalore
in 1988. As a student Colonel Vasanth, was brilliant in academics and a very good athlete.

Dehradun and on 10 June 1989, he was commissioned into 9 MARATHA LI. In a military
career spanning over eighteen years, he served in Pathankot, Sikkim, Gandhinagar, Ranchi,

The MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY was formed as the 103rd Mahrattas in 1768, making it
the senior most Light Infantry Regiment of the Army. Their Regimental Centre has been
Belgaum, Karnataka, since 1922. The battle cry of the MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY is,
‘Bol Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj ki Jai!’ (Cry Victory to Emperor Shivaji!) in tribute to
the Maratha Emperor Shivaji. Indian independence saw the Regiment reverting to the original
five battalions, with the 3 MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY converting to the airborne role and
becoming 2 PARA in April 1952. With the integration of the erstwhile Princely States, the
19th, 20th, 22nd battalions were amalgamated, from the State Forces of Kolhapur, Baroda, and
Hyderabad, with the Regiment. The expansion of the Indian Army to meet the omnipresent
threat to its borders has seen the Regiment grow to its present total of 18 battalions and twoTA battalions whilst the period also saw the conversion of 21st Bn into 21 Para (Special Forces)
and the 115 Infantry battalion (TA) being grouped under the MAHAR Regiment. The five
Mahavir Chakras and the numerous other war and peace time gallantry awards bear testimony
to the front-line leadership and courage of the Regiment’s Officers, JCOs and NCOs. The
regiment has also given Indian Army its 21st Chief of Army Staff (COAS), General Joginder
Jaswant Singh, PVSM, AVSM, VSM, ADC who held the position from February 2005 to
August 2007.

The history of ordnance in India dates back to the 15th century. The early ordnance stores in
the Indian sub-continent were established by the British East India Company for their logistical
requirements. Following the military expansion of the company, the needs of military troops
increased which in turn required the support of an ordnance department. By accepting the report
of then Commander-in-Chief of the Bengal Army, Lieutenant General Sir John Clavering, the
Board of Ordnance was established on 08 April 1775.This is considered to be the first step
towards the recognition of the Army Ordnance Corps (AOC).Lt Navdeep during a Yoga Session

was submitted on 07 April 1875 recommended a centralized system and the establishment of
ordnance factories in the country. As per the recommendation of the report, on 01 April 1884,
the Ordnance Department of India came into existence. Following the Partition of Bengal
(1905), the Ordnance was split into two, each with an Inspector General. Several
reorganizations took place during the tenure of Lord Kitchener as the Commander-in-Chief of
India. With of start of the Second World War in September 1939, the AOC began a major
expansion that continued to the end of the war in 1945. The number of installations rose from
10 to 77 in the span of six years. On 1 May 1943, the Indian Electrical and Mechanical
Engineers (IEME) was separated from Indian Armed Ordnance Corps. After India became
republic on 25 January 1950, the corps was rechristened as the Army Ordnance Corps dropping
the prefix Indian. The Army Ordnance Corps involves the mechanics of provisioning and
procuring of all stores required to raise and maintain an efficient and effective fighting army.
The aim is to make available all kinds of stores to all units of the army at the right time, in right
quantity, at the right place and right cost.Lieutenant Navdeep Singh, Ashoka Chakra (Posthumous) during his training days at the

In August 2011, Lieutenant Navdeep Singh was attached to 15 MARATHA LIGHT
INFANTRY deployed in the High-Altitude Area near Line of Control in Gurez Sector of
Jammu and Kashmir. The MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY was formed as the 103rd
Mahrattas in 1768, making it the senior most light infantry regiment of the Army. Their
Regimental Centre has been Belgaum, Karnataka, since 1922. The battle cry of the
MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY is, ‘Bol Shri Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj ki Jai!’ (Cry
Victory to Emperor Shivaji!) in tribute to the Maratha Emperor Shivaji. Indian independence
saw the Regiment reverting back to the original five battalions, with the 3 MARATHA LIGHT
INFANTRY converting to the airborne role and becoming 2 PARA in April 1952. With the
integration of the erstwhile Princely States, the 19th, 20th, 22nd battalions were amalgamated,
from the State Forces of Kolhapur, Baroda, and Hyderabad, with the Regiment. The expansion
of the Indian Army to meet the omnipresent threat to its borders has seen the Regiment grow
to its present total of 18 battalions and two TA battalions whilst the period also saw the
conversion of 21st Bn into 21 Para (Special Forces) and the 115 Infantry battalion (TA) being
grouped under the MAHAR Regiment. The five Mahavir Chakras and the numerous other war
and peace time gallantry awards bear testimony to the front-line leadership and courage of the
Regiment's Officers, JCOs and NCOs. General JJ Singh (9th and 5th MARATHA LI) became
the first Chief of Army Staff from the Maratha Light Infantry in February 2005.Lieutenant Navdeep Singh, aka ‘The Tiger of Gurez’ during his passing out parade at the

Gurez is a valley located in Himalayas, about 123 kilometres from Srinagar. The valley lies
near the Line of Control and has been an area of insurgency. High mountains and closeness to
the LoC enable Pakistani terrorists to infiltrate. Don't worry I am very safe. There is no threat
to my life,.' Navdeep used to tell his mother on the phone whenever she grew anxious about
his safety defending the Line of Control, the cease-fire line separating India-Pakistan in Jammu
and Kashmir, where Indian soldiers have sacrificed their lives battling Pakistani terrorists. He
never complained about being posted in such a difficult and sensitive area, in fact he loved it
and wanted to stay on. Mother and son did not talk much on the phone because connectivity
was limited at his location, but Navdeep would call 3, 4 times whenever he came down to
Srinagar. 'Mummy, you must come and meet me in Srinagar. It is beautiful, more beautiful
than any other foreign country,' Navdeep would tell his mother who had previously been in the
legendary city of beauty as a BEd student in 1983, a few years before militancy ushered trouble
into paradise.Lieutenant Navdeep Singh as a young officer.

Recognized for his leadership and tactical acumen, Lieutenant Navdeep Singh was appointed
as the Commander of the Ghatak Platoon—a specialized commando unit within the infantry
known for its deadly precision and combat readiness. The name ""Ghatak,"" meaning ""killer"" or
""lethal"" in Hindi, aptly describes the unit's mission to engage in high-risk operations.
On 20 August 2011 at 12:30 hours the Surveillance teams of 15 MARATHA LI spotted some
terrorists. For Lieutenant Navdeep Singh Bains this was barely five months after his
commissioning into the army. It was the biggest-ever infiltration attempt in J&K that year.
Terrorists dressed in black commando combat dresses armed with AK-47 rifles, Chinese-made
7.62 mm pistols and communication devices were attempting to infiltrate the LoC using
inflatable rubber boats on Kishnaganga River, considered the de facto LoC between India and
Pakistan.
The intelligence indicating that a group of 17 heavily armed terrorists had infiltrated Indian
territory through the Gurez Sector. The Ghatak Platoon, under Lieutenant Navdeep Singh's
command, was tasked with intercepting and neutralizing the infiltrators. Displaying remarkable
foresight and tactical expertise, Lieutenant Navdeep Singh accurately identified the likely routeof the terrorists and deployed his troops in a manner that would give them a strategic
advantage.
The officer gauged the likely route of the terrorists and laid an ambush at the appropriate spot.
When the terrorists were spotted, the ambush was sprung by the officer himself. An exchange
of intense fire ensued. Leading from front, the officer eliminated three terrorists at close range.
On seeing another terrorist approaching their positions, with utter disregard to his personal
safety, the officer swiftly changed his firing position. While doing so, he got hit by a bullet on
his head. He nevertheless managed to eliminate the fourth terrorist. Further, displaying utmost
bravery and comradeship, he pulled an injured fellow-soldier to safety and kept firing till he
became unconscious due to excessive blood loss. A total of 12 terrorists were eliminated during
the operation and the infiltration bid was foiled successfully. Lt Navdeep later succumbed to
his injuries and was martyred at the age of 26 years.

The news of Lieutenant Navdeep Singh's martyrdom sent shockwaves through his hometown,
Gurdaspur and across the nation. His body was airlifted to a hospital in Srinagar where General
Officer Commanding (GOC) of 15 Corps Lieutenant General Syed Atta Hasnain, PVSM,
UYSM, AVSM, SM, VSM** paid floral tributes before being transported to his hometown,
where he was laid to rest with full military honours. Thousands gathered to pay their respects
to the brave officer who had laid down his life for the safety and security of his country. A
State Cabinet Minister representing the Chief Minister of Punjab laid a wreath on his body. Hewas cremated with full State and Army honours amid crowd showering flowers and chanting
“Navdeep Singh amar rahe”. 16 JAK LI paid him a gun salute. The roads were so crowded
with mourners, the cremation was delayed by two hours.

At his funeral, many who shed tears for him did not know him or his family. Mourners drawn
not by compulsion, but respect for a soldier who made the ultimate sacrifice, defending the
country. The town's municipal corporation swept the streets the morning of the funeral, soldiers
from his regiment gave him the final salute, a state cabinet minister representing the chief
minister laid a wreath on his body wrapped in the Indian flag.1
Army officers whom the family did not know condoled with his parents, telling them about the
valour of their son. ""Pata nahi kitni duniya hogi (I can't fathom how much of the world was
there),"" says his mother looking back at that day of loss and mourning when strangers mourned
for her son as if he were their own.
Lieutenant Navdeep Singh displayed his indomitable spirit, determination and exceptional
bravery while putting down the terrorists and making the supreme sacrifice for the nation.
For his exceptional bravery and conspicuous courage in the face of enemy, he was awarded
Ashoka Chakra posthumously.

IA-219,Brigadier,Mohammad Usman,"5/10 Baluch (Jacob Rifles), 50 Para Brigade","Brigadier Mohammad Usman was born on 15 July 1921 at Bibipur (Now, Mau) in Azamgarh
District of then United Province (now, Uttar Pradesh). His father Kazi Mohammad Farook was a
Kotwal of the main Police Station in Banaras (Varanasi). His father was given the title of Khan
Bahadur by the British Government. He had three elder sisters and two brothers. One of his older
brothers, Gufran was a Brigadier in the Indian Army. Brigadier Usman completed his schooling
from Harish Chandra High School, Banaras. His father wanted him to join the civil services, but
he was always inclined towards joining the Indian Army.
Source: Honourpoint
Courage and selflessness came naturally to Brigadier Usman, at a very young age of twelve, he
jumped into a well to save a drowning child. On applying to the Indian Army he was selected
along with ten other Indians in the last batch of Indian Officers to pass out from Sandhrust.
Among 45 cadets, he secured thirtieth position in the order of merit. The seventh Chief of Army
Staff, General Sam Manekshaw was three days junior to Brigadier Usman. He started his Army
career with a mandatory one-year attachment to the Scottish Rifles before getting commissioned
into 5/10 Baluch (Jacob’s Rifles). After some regimental and staff duties, Brigadier Usman
found himself with 16/10 Baluch in the Arakran (Burma) towards the end of the Second World
War. Here, he served as the Battalion’s 2IC along with later General Zorawar Chand Bakshi.
Meanwhile, the situation in Jammu and Kashmir turned grim, due to tribal invasion supported by
regular Pakistan Army troops.The first Indo-Pak war fought between the independent countries of India and Pakistan began in
1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan were the attempts by Pakistan to annex
the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. On the map of India, the state of
Jammu and Kashmir appeared as a somewhat rectangular projection in the extreme North-West
corner of the sub-continent. In size it was the largest of the Indian ‘Princely States’ during the
pre-independence era. It was 222,870 sq km or roughly double the area of Demark, the
Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg combined. The state was important because of its strategic
location. Even before the birth of Pakistan, Jammu and Kashmir was surrounded on almost three
sides by foreign states. Today, its importance has been accentuated by recent international
developments. To the East lay Tibet; to its North lies Chinese Turkestan or Sinkiang (Xinjiang);
to West is Afghanistan; to South-West and South was Pakistan; and to the South and South-East
lay the states of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh of India.1 The narrow Wakhan corridor, a narrow
strip of territory in Afghanistan, extending to China and separating Tajikistan from Gilgit-
Baltistan, was to the North West. Some of the significant battles that took place in Jammu and
Kashmir were, the Battle of Badgam, capture and recapture of Jhangar, battle of Naushera, the
advance to Tithwal, the relief in Punch and the fight of Chhamb to Tithwal.

passed on to Brigadier Mohammad Usman from Brigadier Paranjpe who had to be evacuated
due to medical reasons. Jhangar which was being held by 1 Rajput less a Company was soon
overrun by the invaders. 1 PARA (Punjab) suffered 55 dead and 46 wounded in defending
Jhangar. By January 1948, the enemy was dominating all the four roads leading out of
Naushera.2

nine kms North-East of Naushera. It was the highest feature in the area and dominated the
Naushera defences. Taking the wish of Gen Cariappa as his command, Brigadier Mohammad
Usman launched an Op KIPPER (Kipper being the nickname of Gen Cariappa) on 31 January-
01 February 1948. 3 PARA (MARTHA) captured Pathradi and Uparla from the right while 2/2
PUNJAB, 7 Cavalry and a Company less a Platoon of Mahar Medium Machine gunners were in
supporting role. The enemy suffered 156 dead and 200 wounded. This was the first major reverse
suffered by the enemy. Several enemy counter attacks on Kot were beaten back due to a clever
positioning of troops by Brigadier Usman. 3

On 14 March 1948, 50 Para Brigade and 19 Infantry Brigade launched Op VIJAY to capture
Jhangar from two axis. 19 Brigade took the North axis while 50 Para Brigade consisting of 3
PARA (Maratha), 3 PARA (RAJPUT), 1 PATIALA and one Company of 3/1 PUNJAB attacked
from another direction. 4 Prior to the attack, Brigdier Usman had issued a Special Order of the
Day exhorting his men into battle. It was this famous Order of the Day, in which he quoted Lord
Macaulay’s famous poem, ‘Horatius’.
3 Ibid (Pg no. 158)
4 Ibid (Pg no. 158)Source: Twitter @ADGPI-Indian Army
The order reads-
Comrades of 50 Para Brigade Group,
Time has come when our planning and preparation for the recapture of Jhangar has to be put to
test. It is not an easy task bit I am confident o success- because our plan is sound and our
preparations have been good. More so, because I have complete confidence in you all to do your
best to recapture the ground we lost on 24 December and to retrieve the honour of our arms.
They eyes of the world are on us. The hopes and aspirations of our countrymen are based upon
our efforts. We must not falter- we must not fail them.
To every man upon this earth,
Death cometh soon or late,
And how can man die better,
Than facing fearful odds.
For the ashes of his fathers,And the temples of his gods.
So forward friends, fearless we go to Jhangar. India expects everyone to do his duty. 5
Brigadier Mohammad Usman had worked out a very detailed Artillery Fire Plan for the battle of
Jhangar. He had brigaded all the twenty-four field guns and the Mortars of the three Battalions.
He had concentrated them on a limited front targeting the highest point of the feature, which was
attacked first. Once the barrage lifted, the troops were already at the enemy trenches taking them
by surprise. 3 PARA (MARATHA) secured Pir Thal Naka on 17 March 1948 and Uparli Karhali
on 18 March and then pressed on to Susloti Dhar along with a Company of 3 PARA (RAJPUT).
Brigadier Usman soon followed up with his Headquarters (HQ). 3 PARA (MARATHA) and 1
PATIALA advancing on a two battalion front secured Pt 3399. 19 Infantry Brigade had already
entered Jhangar and ‘Op VIJAY’ was complete.6 Brigadier Usman had taken a vow to not sleep
on a cot till he had avenged the loss of Jhangar. Staying true to his vow, he had spent nearly three
months on the floor despite temperatures dropping to zero almost every night. With the success
of Op VIJAY, he redeemed his pledge and asked for a cot to be brought.
Following the success of Jhangar, 19 Infantry Brigade withdrew to Naushera, while 50 Para
Brigade, was assigned the task to hold Jhangar. Several enemy counter attacks were beaten back
in the next three months, the two major ones were on 16 April and 10 May, 1948. However, an
attack by 3 PARA (MARATHA) and 2 RAJPUTANA RIFLES (from 19 Infantry Brigade) on
MG Hill suffered reverses due to faulty intelligence on enemy strength on that feature.
After the fall of Kotli and Jhangar, Brigadier Usman had restored the low morale of 50 Para
Brigade and encouraged his men to put up a fierce fight in the battles of Naushera and Thal
Naka. These battles bear testimony to his dynamic leadership and charismatic personality.
Although he was a hard taskmaster, he was quick to reward a person for his good deeds and
bravery, making him popular and loved among both officers and men. He could not stand men
who failed to perform to their optimum levels. Still, he gave a fair hearing before reprimanding a
person. He believed loyalty was a two-way street and always stood up for his subordinates. In
one such instance, his Brigade Intelligence Officer had sent a signal to the HQ JAK Force giving
the six-figure map reference of one of our own positions which was later shelled by the enemy.
A signal from HQ JAK Force demanded the Captain’s head on a plate for his carelessness. A
weary Captain SC Sinha (who was on attachment with the Brigade from 3 PARA (Maratha)
walked into Brig Usman’s office with the signal. Brig Usman without speaking a word and

enemy”. This was the last that was heard of the matter.

In June 1948, own aerial reconnaissance observed manned gun positions to the South of Jhangar.
HQ JAK Force issued instructions to 50 Para Brigade to provide overhead protections to the
bunkers and trenches. But this warning was not taken seriously as the enemy had never shelled
Jhangar after it was recaptured. The Brigade HQ was nothing more than a series of tents.
On 03 July 1948, Brigadier Mohammad Usman in accordance to his daily routine, held an
evening meeting half and hour early at 1700 Hours. At 1745 Hours enemy started shelling at the
Brigade HQ. This act by the enemy led to a massive blood shed in Indian camp. The first set of
shells landed 500 meters north of crossroads. These were ranging shots, since the next salvo
landed nearer, everyone scrambled for cover. Brigadier Usman along with few other staff
officers was taking a walk near the HQ after the evening meeting. After the shelling started, they
found cover under large overhanging rock in the terraced field, just above the signallers’ bunker.
Brigadier Usman was being accompanied by his Battery Commander, Major Bhagwan Singh andBrigade Intelligence Officer Captain SC Sinha. In an effort to silence enemy fire, our own field
battery began to return fire. But realising the futility of effort to fire at well entrenched enemy,
Brigadier Mohammad Usman displaying great awareness of his surroundings, was quick to
realise that Point 3150 was obvious place for enemy to site its artillery Observation Post (OP),
ordered Major Bhagwan Singh to turn his guns to West and engage Point 3150. Major Singh was
puzzled and later appreciated Brigadier’s presence of mind and followed his order. He also
ordered his eight other gunners engage the target indicated by Brigadier Mohammad Usman.
This achieved the desired result and the enemy guns ceased firing.
The shelling had damaged the wireless aerials on top of the command post, which was located a
few metres away. Once the shelling stopped, a few signallers, led by Lieutenant Ram Singh of
the Brigade Signal Company, came out and started repairing the aerials. Usman, too, decided to
move to the Brigade Command Post.
He started off ahead, leaving Major Bhagwan Singh and Captain SC Sinha to follow. They had
barely taken a few steps when Bhagwan Singh heard a sound, which he immediately recognised
as artillery gunfire. Instinctively, he caught Sinha by the arm and pulled him back. By now,
Usman had reached the entrance to the Command Post, where he had stopped to have a few
encouraging words with the signallers. Just then, a 25-pounder shell landed on the rock nearby.
The flying splinters killed Usman on the spot, wounding Lieutenant Ram Singh and two of the
signallers working outside. The shelling continued throughout the night, and about 800 shells
were dropped on Jhangar. Fortunately, except for two abortive attempts at infiltration by a
Company, it was not followed by an infantry attack. Besides Brigadier Usman, four men lost
their lives during the shelling, while eight were wounded, including three officers.7

For his last journey, they used the brand-new caravan, which had just his bed and which Usman
had not yet had the chance to use. When the troops lined up on the road to bid him farewell, there
was not a single one among them whose eyes were not wet. Veteran soldiers cried unashamedly
for the man who had endeared himself to all of them in so short a time. From Jammu, his body
was flown to Delhi, where a large crowd had gathered to pay homage to a brave son who had
laid down his life for his motherland. The government decided to honour him with a state
funeral, which was held at Mehrauli, and was attended by Governor General Lord Mountbatten
and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Shortly thereafter, the government announced that Usman
had been posthumously awarded the MVC, the second highest award for gallantry in India.8
Mohammad Usman was the seniormost Indian officer to have lost his life during the Jammu and
Kashmir operations of 1947-48. Even today, he is venerated by the people of Jammu and the
surrounding region. Memorials have been built at Naushera and Jhangar, where veterans gather
on the anniversary of his death to honour his memory. The memorial at Jhangar is built on the

IC-2777,Lieutenant Colonel (Then Major),K L Suri,1 SIKH,"Lieutenant Colonel (Then Major) KL Suri was born on 19 March 1921, in a village named
Malakwal in then undivided Punjab. Prior to the partition of the subcontinent in 1947, there were
three Malakwals. One being on the outskirts of Batala another one in Fatehgarh Churian, and the
third one in Mandi Bahaudin. Major Suri was born in the third Malakwal which, after partition,
became part of Pakistan. After passing FA (present day equivalent of Senior Secondary), K L
Suri joined the Indian Military Academy and was commissioned into 1st Battalion of the SIKH
REGIMENT on 02 July, 1942. During partition of India in August 1947, the Suri family
migrated to the India and settled at Delhi.1
After the Maharaja of Kashmir signed the instrument of accession on 26 October, 1947, a
battalion group composed of the 1 Sikh, a battery of 13 Field Regiment Artillery, an Engineer
Platoon and two companies of 4 Kumaon were airlifted to Srinagar. The battalion group fought
its way through and not just halted the Pakistani raiders miles away from Srinagar but in
subsequent pitched battles also pushed them back from its area of responsibility. It was during a
close quarter battle between 1 Sikh and Pak invaders in Tithwal Sector in May, 1948, Major K L
Suri, who was commanding a company, went beyond call of dutyand displayed inspiring
leadership and personal gallantry, for which he was awarded the Vir Chakra. He retired from the
army on 31 March 1971, in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
The SIKH Regiment is one of the highest decorated regiments of the Indian Army. It came into
existence on 01 August 1846, with the raising of Regiment of Ferozepore Sikhs and Regiment of
Ludhiana Sikhs by Captain G Tebbs and Lieutenant Colonel P Gordon respectively. They
participated effectively in the 1857 First War of Independence. This War proved to be beneficial
for the Sikhs as it revealed their valour and fighting tenacity. They soon earned a rank of
seniority over other Indian Sepoys. Under the British Indian Army, the SIKH Regiment fought
gallantly in a number of war and battles including the Battle of Saragarhi in which they left an
indelible mark in the regiment’s history. By 1914, the SIKH Regiment was deployed as part of
British Indian Army for operations in World War I. The Regiment served in all theatres of
operations and earned 28 battle honours. The modern SIKH Regiment traces its roots directly
from the 11th SIKH Regiment of the British Indian Army. When transferred to the Indian Army
post-Independence, the numeral 11 was removed and new battalions were added.2
The first Indo-Pak War fought between the independent countries of India and Pakistan began in
1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan were the attempts by Pakistan to annex
the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. On the map of India, the state of
Jammu and Kashmir appeared as a somewhat rectangular projection in the extreme North-West

pre-independence era. It was 222,870sq km or roughly double the area of Demark, the
Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg combined. The state was important because of its strategic
location. Even before the birth of Pakistan, Jammu and Kashmir was surrounded on almost three
sides by foreign states. Today, its importance has been accentuated by recent international
developments. To the East lay Tibet; to its North lies Chinese Turkestan or Sinkiang (Xinjiang);

Defence,Government of IndiaThe Battle of Tithwal was one of the fiercest and longest battles fought during conflict in 1947-
48. During initial stages, Pashtun tribal militia had crossed the border and occupied strategically
important village of Tithwal on Indian side. Their primary aim was to capture the Richmar Gali
located South of Tithwal and Nastachun Pass, which was held by Indian Army. A massive attack
was launched by Pakistan Army on 13 October 1948 hoping to capture the posts held by Indian
troops, but failed miserably, with heavy casualties due to undaunting courage and valour
displayed by Indian troops. The indomitable spirit and determination of Indian Army helped
India in retaining the post of Tithwal. The battalions involved were 1 SIKH, 1 MADRAS, 6
RAJPUTANA RIFLES. Tithwal, in Jammu and Kashmir, was captured on 23 May 1948. After
that date, the enemy made numerous attempts to recapture Richmar Gali and thereafter Tithwal.
A number of battles were fought around Tithwal in the summer of 1948

On 31 May 1948, in an operation near Tithwal in the Kashmir Valley, 1 SIKH was given Mir
Kalsi Ridge as its objective. To achieve this objective, it was necessary that point 7802 be
secured. This high feature was very strongly held by well-trained enemy. “A” Company was
detailed to attack and capture this feature. Major KL Suri Commander of “B” Company, who
had suffered few casualties on the previous attack on one of the enemy positions, again
volunteered to take his company to capture this feature. Going ahead with his leading platoon,
Major Suri suddenly came under heavy fire from the enemy who was on higher feature than him.
Taking up his position right under the enemy, Major Suri organised and led flanking attack on
the enemy. Encouraging his men with the Sikh war cry “BOLE SO NIHAL-SAT SRI AKAL’ he
egged on his men, waving his stick and pushing his men on to the objective.The battle that ensued was fierce and long one, and the Platoon was held up due to heavy
opposition. Major Suri then decided to push his 3rd Platoon through and going back he took this
Platoon up and charged on the enemy, inflicting great number of casualties. Not satisfied with
this, he took out fighting patrol and recovered 23 of the enemy dead, lot of equipment and stores.
Major Suri’s fearless leadership, calm and clear judgment in the midst of the enemy and presence
of mind was the only factor, which enabled his company to achieve what it did. It was later
confirmed that the enemy was so demoralised that he fled from positions further behind. This
action facilitated the Battalion's further advance and the final capture of Mir Kalsi Ridge.
Major K L Suri was awarded Vir Chakra for his display of exceptional courage, devotion to duty
and sparkling leadership in the face of enemy.","On 31 May 1948, in an operation near Tithwal in the Kashmir Valley, the First Battalion ofthe

Indian Army since his childhood. His father was Shri Gouri Nath Chopra, Major Satyapal
Chopra was commissioned into the Indian Army at a young age of twenty years on 01 July 1942.
He was commissioned into the MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY, a Regiment known for its
intrepid soldiers and gallantry in various operations. In the 1947-48 Indo-Pak War, 3 (PARA)
MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY fought under the leadership Brigadier Mohammad Usman who
was commanding 50 Para Brigade. 50 Para Brigade was responsible for multiple successful
endeavours during the war. The recapture of Jhangar remains one of the crucial wins of the
brigade.
The MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY was formed as the 103rd Mahrattas in 1768, making it the
senior most light infantry regiment of the Army. Their Regimental Centre has been Belgaum,
Karnataka, since 1922. The battle cry of the MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY is, ‘Bol Shri
Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj ki Jai!’ (Cry Victory to Emperor Shivaji!) in tribute to the Maratha
Emperor Shivaji. Indian independence saw the Regiment reverting back to the original five
battalions, with the 3 MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY converting to the airborne role and
becoming 2 PARA in April 1952. With the integration of the erstwhile Princely States, the 19th,
20th, 22nd battalions were amalgamated, from the State Forces of Kolhapur, Baroda, and
Hyderabad, with the Regiment. The expansion of the Indian Army to meet the omnipresent threat
to its borders has seen the Regiment grow to its present total of 18 battalions and two TA
battalions whilst the period also saw the conversion of 21st Bn into 21 Para (Special Forces) and
the 115 Infantry battalion (TA) being grouped under the MAHAR Regiment. The five Mahavir
Chakras and the numerous other war and peace time gallantry awards bear testimony to the
front-line leadership and courage of the Regiment's Officers, JCOs and NCOs. Gen J.J. Singh
(9th and 5th) became the first Chief of Army Staff from the Maratha Light Infantry in Feb 2005.
1 During the 1947-48 Indo-Pak war, 3 (PARA) MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY was a part of
50 Para Brigade commanded by Brigadier Usman Mohammad. The battalion participated in the
crucial battles of Jhangar and Naushera. General JJ Singh , who was the Chief of Army Staff

lay the states of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh of India.2 The narrow Wakhan corridor, a narrow
strip of territory in Afghanistan, extending to China and separating Tajikistan from Gilgit-
Baltistan, was to the North West. Some of the significant battles that took place in Jammu and
Kashmir were, the Battle of Badgam, capture and recapture of Jhangar, battle of Naushera, the
advance to Tithwal, the relief in Punch and the fight of Chhamb to Tithwal.
The attack by Pakistani raiders on Jammu and Kashmir which commenced in Oct 1947
continued unabated and they captured Jhangar on 24 Dec 1947. The capture of Jhangar gave
them the strategic advantage to push for their advance to Naushera and Poonch. Thus the
recapture of Jhangar became very important to thwart the advance of enemy forces to Naushera.
In order to to recapture Jhangar, On 14 March 1948, 50 Para Brigade and 19 Infantry Brigade
launched Op VIJAY to capture Jhangar from two axis. 19 Brigade took the North axis while 50
Para Brigade consisting of 3 PARA (Maratha), 3 PARA (RAJPUT), 1 PATIALA and one
Company of 3/1 PUNJAB attacked from another direction. 3
Brigadier Usman Mohammad had worked out a very detailed Artillery Fire Plan for the battle of
Jhangar. He had brigaded all the twenty-four field guns and the Mortars of the three Battalions.
He had concentrated them on a limited front targeting the highest point of the feature, which was
attacked first. Once the barrage lifted, the troops were already at the enemy trenches taking them
by surprise.
On 15 March 1948, at about 0830 hours, the two 3 (PARA) MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY
Companies moved out on offensive reconnaissance to locate enemy positions in the Pir Thil area.
The area had a dominating hill feature, Pir Thil Nakka where the enemy forces had entrenched
themselves and were keeping a close watch on Indian forces. The movement did not go
unnoticed and the enemy forces waited for the companies to come closer. They held fire till
companies reached the open ground within 185 meters of their position. The Companies were

automatics.
Major Satyapal Chopra was commanding the left forward Company during the advance. The
hostiles lay strongly entrenched on Pir Thil Nakka, a formidable hill feature, with their bunker
well camouflaged. Both the companies came under heavy fire and were pinned to the ground. In
a complete disregard for his personal safety, Major Chopra rushed forward with one platoon to
an intermediate position from where he gave his troops covering fire. He was wounded in the
face but he kept on fighting. He then turned to the evacuation of his wounded men who were
lying on the exposed ground swept by enemy machine guns. He managed to remove three of his
men but as he was trying to remove the fourth man, he was shot through the head and he
succumbed to his injuries. This brave commissioned officer displayed conspicuous courage,
exemplary leadership and made supreme sacrifice in the line of duty.
3 PARA (MARATHA) secured Pir Thal Naka on 17 March 1948 and Uparli Karhali on 18
March and then pressed on to Susloti Dhar along with a Company of 3 PARA (RAJPUT).
Brigadier Usman soon followed up with his Headquarters (HQ). 3 PARA (MARATHA) and 1

MEDIUM Regiment of Artillery on 05 July 1942. He belonged to Dharampur, Himachal Pradesh.
During 1947-48 Indo-Pak War, he single-handedly manned his position and refused to evacuate
despite being aware of the threat to his life.
The Regiment of Artillery was raised on 28 September 1827. It was initially raised as Bombay
Artillery and was later renamed 5 Bombay Mountain Battery. In May 1857, the mutiny by Indian
soldiers started in the artillery of the Army of the Bengal Presidency. The incident prompted a
complete ban on Indian artillery units, except the mountain artillery batteries in select provinces.
The decision was reversed in the mid-1930s when the first of the Field Regiments of the Indian
Army were raised. The Field Regiments support the formations on the field. The regimental motto
of Artillery Regiment ‘Sarvatra Izzat-O-Iqbal’ which means ‘Everywhere with Honour and Glory’.
The first Indo-Pak war fought between the independent countries of India and Pakistan began in
1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan were the attempts by Pakistan to annex
the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. On the map of India, the state of Jammu

got loose when on 14 December enemy turned all available guns of two regiments on the Naushera
area. 5.5-inch medium guns, 25 pounders, 3.7-inch heavy ack-ack guns and 75 mms from medium
tanks pounded mercilessly the Naushera area. Between 1100 hours and 2000 hours that day, enemy

Government of Indiafired 2,000 shells into an area with a radius of 11 km. At the farthest point they picked on targets
at Beri Pattan, 16 km south-east of Naushera. Their targets included Beri Pattan, Seri, Naushera,
Punjab Hill, Nothi Dhar, Kaman Gosha, Grund Gala and the much-shelled Chhawa ridge. The
shelling continued through the night with varying intensity and was resumed next morning. On 16
December enemy shelled the Tactical Headquarters accurately and heavily. Altogether, enemy
fired well over 5,000 shells in this bombardment. The defenders simply stayed put and held on.
After their heavy pounding, the Pakistanis perhaps expected to find them abandoned.
Unfortunately for them, the two battalions had held on to their positions and effectively fire greeted
the Pakistanis, after which they withdrew.
Chhawa ridge suffered the most. Captain Mistri of 1 Medium Battery, 40 Medium Regiment
Artillery, was an Observation Officer at the forward-most picket. On 15 December, the enemy
shelled his post relentlessly, using howitzers and 4.2-inch mortars. Despite the murderous fire, this
officer stuck to his post and it was due to his fearless conduct that enemy guns were pin-pointed
in this sector. He reported the presence of Sherman tanks on his front, in the Sandoa village area
and remained at his post when these tanks engaged his picquet for more than two hours.
He did not listen to the entreaties of his platoon commander to seek safety, but continued to observe
and pass back information to the guns till a 75-mm shell hit his position, killing him on the spot.
By day and by night this gallant officer continued to be a resilient guard of the picquet. His personal
courage, unparalleled gallantry and devotion to duty with utter disregard for personal safety was a

Army. After finishing his education from village High School, Lieutenant Colonel Dharam Singh
enlisted in 1/19 HYDERABAD REGIMENT of the British Indian Army in 1932. He steadily rose
through the ranks and was commissioned on 15 May, 1941. Later, 1/19th HYDERABD
REGIMENT was re-designated as 1 PARA (KUMAON).
During World War II, he was deployed in the North West Frontier Province (February, 1940 –
March, 1941), Middle East (October, 1941- 1944) as part of the Persia and Iraq Force and Burma
(July 1944 - August 1945). Post independence, he actively served and became the Commanding
Officer of the Battalion. He was awarded Maha Vir Chakra during the First Indo Pak war on 08
November 1948. during the second Poonch link up (OPERATION EASY) for the capture of Point

Lieutenant Colonel Dharam Singh retired from Service in July, 1962. He led a very active life after
his retirement. After retirement, he was the Vice-President of the Zila Sainik Board, Bhiwani for
many years. He lived a long and happy life and breathed his last on 18 August 1984 at the old age
of 74 years.
The KUMAON Regiment traces its origins to the 18th century and has fought in every major
campaign of the British Indian Army and the Indian Army including the two world wars. During
World War I, a Kumaon battalion was raised at Ranikhet on 23 October 1917 as 34/39th Kumaon
Rifles. In 1918, it was redesigned as 1st battalion, 50th Kumaon Rifles and a second battalion was
raised. These were merged with Hyderabad contingent into the 19th Hyderabad Regiment in 1923.
On 27 October 1945, the 19th Hyderabad was renamed as 19 Kumaon Regiment. Post
Independence, it has been known as the Kumaon Regiment. Staying true to the regimental motto
of Parakramo Vijayate (Valour Triumphs) the regiment has proved its mettle in Indo-Pak War of
1947-48, Sino-India War of 1962, Indo-Pak War 1971, Kargil War of 1999 and also participated
in the Indian Peace-keeping Force in Sri Lanka. During the Sino-India War of 1962, 13 KUMAON
displayed conspicuous courage and undaunted determination while fighting the enemy during the
Battle of Rezang La, where Major Shaitan Singh received the Param Vir Chakra.1 The KUMAON
Regiment has contributed three Chiefs to the Indian Army namely General SM Shringesh, General
KS Thimayya, DSO and General TN Raina, MVC.

1 Ballabh, Anand, Insights into Infantry Regiments: A Basic Factbook. Forward Books publications. New Delhi (2013)remained a part of the regiment until April 1952 when it was formally inducted into the Parachute
Regiment as 3 PARA (KUMAON). Later in 2000, the battalion was converted to Special Forces
as part of the expansion of the special operations forces of the Indian Army, and renamed 3rd
Battalion Para (Special Forces) or 3 PARA (SF).
The Parachute Regiment is an airborne and special forces regiment of the Indian Army. It was
raised in 1945 as part of the British Indian Army but was disbanded after the World War II and
was re-raised in 1952 by absorbing the three existing parachute battalions of the 50th Parachute
Brigade. In the post-independence restructuring, India retained only one parachute brigade—the
50th. This brigade consisted of three distinguished battalions personally nominated by the then
Commander-in-Chief, namely 1 PARA (PUNJAB), 2 PARA (MARATHA) and 3 PARA
(KUMAON). During the Jammu and Kashmir operations of 1947-48 these battalions
distinguished themselves with glory in the battles of Shelatang, Naushera, Jhangar and Poonch,
and were awarded the respective Battle Honours. On 15 April 1952, the three battalions serving
with the Parachute Brigade were removed from their respective Infantry Regiments to form the
PARACHUTE REGIMENT. Since then, The Regiment has participated in 1962 War, 1971 War,
Op PAWAN, Op CACTUS, and 1999 Kargil War. Currently it comprises seven Special Forces,
six Airborne, two Territorial Army and one Rashtriya Rifles Battalions.
The first Indo-Pak war fought between the independent countries of India and Pakistan began in
1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan were the attempts by Pakistan to annex
the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. On the map of India, the state of Jammu
and Kashmir appeared as a somewhat rectangular projection in the extreme North-West corner of
the sub-continent. In size it was the largest of the Indian ‘Princely States’ during the pre-
independence era. It was 222,870sq km or roughly double the area of Demark, the Netherlands,
Belgium and Luxemburg combined. The state was important because of its strategic location. Even
before the birth of Pakistan, Jammu and Kashmir was surrounded on almost three sides by foreign
states. Today, its importance has been accentuated by recent international developments. To the
East lay Tibet; to its North lies Chinese Turkestan or Sinkiang (Xinjiang); to West is Afghanistan;
to South-West and South was Pakistan; and to the South and South-East lay the states of Punjab
and Himachal Pradesh of India.2 The narrow Wakhan corridor, a narrow strip of territory in
Afghanistan, extending to China and separating Tajikistan from Gilgit-Baltistan, was to the North
West.

By the end of May 1948, the Poonch Brigade had succeeded in consolidating its position. The
stage was now set up for an operation for the link up with 19 Brigade’s advance from Rajauri to
Thana Mandi and Surankot, where the Link up was to be effected with a battalion of Poonch
Brigade from Poonch. Lieutenant General S M Shrinagesh, who was appointed Corps Commanderin overall command of J&K Force on 14 September 1948 was planning for operation ‘EASY’ for
the final link up with Poonch. An attempt to link up Poonch could be made either from the South,
namely via Thana Mandi or Rajauri, or form the North via the Haji Pir Pass. Lieutenant General
Cariappa didn’t approve of the plan for the link up by the North route but sanctioned the link up
with Poonch by South route. By 28 October, 268 Infantry Brigade and 5 Infantry Brigade
succeeded in capturing two vital ridges for the link up, Pir Badesar and Pir Kalewa respectively.
The objective was now to capture Ramgarh fort and Bhimbar Gali, preparatory to the capture of
Mendhar and the advance to Poonch.
Brigadier Yadunath Singh, commander of Durga force, which was to undertake Operation EASY
and was composed of 5 Infantry Brigade, 19 Infantry Brigade and the Rajauri Garrison., planned
to make two brigades converge on Bhimbar Gali – 5 Infantry Brigade Group, operating from Pir
Kalewa and Point 6980 to Bhimbar Gali and 19 Infantry Brigade Group capturing Point 6944 to
Point 6307. The third Brigade was protecting the left flank of the two attacking columns. The phase
I of the operation was to start by capturing Point 4844, Ramgarh Fort and Point 6480.
5 Infantry Brigade secured the left flank of Bhimbar Gali by capturing Point 6911 and Point 6980.
Meanwhile, to secure the Right Flank, 19 Infantry Brigade was capturing the ridge from Point
6944 to Point 6360. 45 Field Battery (less Troop) was in support of the Brigade along with SQN
No.10 RIAF, SQN No. 12 RIAF and No 1 AOP (RFT) RIAF were available for air support.
1 (PARA) KUMAON started climbing the feature, Point 6307, after crossing a Nala on 07
November. Advance went on smoothly but slowly as it was a very rough country and steep
climbing up to Dhori Dhara. At Dhori Dhara, A Company, the leading Company, came under
heavy fire from enemy automatics and rifles form Mangalvar. A Company made a spirited charge
and secured Mangalvar on 08 November. Enemy offered resistance from four other tactical
features but all resistance were overcome and Point 6307, the objective was secured at 0600 hours
on 08 November. It was during this action, when Lieutenant Colonel Dharam Singh, the
Commanding Officer of the Battalion displayed bravery, initiative and strong leadership making
the attack successful.
On the night of 07 November 1948, during the attack, Lieutenant Colonel Dharam Singh was with
the left forward Company, leading from the front. He led his battalion extremely well over very
rugged terrain and against a very well determined enemy. Throughout the advance, disregarding
his personal safety, he remained in the forefront of the attacking companies in five actions during
the night. Since the attack was during the night, artillery fire support could not be made available
but even without that, the soldiers maintained the momentum of the attack. During the final assault
on the enemy defences, Lieutenant Colonel Dharam Singh was with the assaulting Company withthe bayonets drawn. Seeing their Commanding Officer leading the assault, the men attacked the
feature with more vigour and captured the objective at dawn.
Lieutenant Colonel Dharam Singh’s conduct in carrying out this attack was an inspiration to all
his men throughout the action. For personal bravery, initiative and strong leadership, he was
awarded with nation’s second highest gallantry award Maha Vir Chakra.","Lt Col Dharam Singh (IC-2447), 1 (Para) Bn, The Kumaon Regiment (08 November 1948)
On the night of 07 November 1948, during the attack on a feature, Lieutenant Colonel Dharam
Singh led his battalion extremely well over a difficult country and against a determined enemy. To
capture the feature, he fought five actions in pitch darkness without artillery support.
This officer was always with his forward company and did not care for his personal safety. His
conduct in carrying out this attack was an inspiration to all his men, which eventually led to the
capture of the feature at dawn. But for his personal bravery, initiative and strong leadership this
attack would not have succeeded jeopardising the entire operation.

The MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY was formed as the 103rd Mahrattas in 1768, making it the
senior most light infantry regiment of the Army. Their Regimental Centre has been Belgaum,
Karnataka, since 1922. The battle cry of the MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY is, ‘Bol Shri
Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj ki Jai!’ (Cry Victory to Emperor Shivaji!) in tribute to the Maratha
Emperor Shivaji. Indian independence saw the Regiment reverting back to the original five
battalions, with the 3 MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY converting to the airborne role and
becoming 2 PARA in April 1952. With the integration of the erstwhile Princely States, the 19th,
20th, 22nd battalions were amalgamated, from the State Forces of Kolhapur, Baroda, and
Hyderabad, with the Regiment. The expansion of the Indian Army to meet the omnipresent threat
to its borders has seen the Regiment grow to its present total of 18 battalions and two TA battalions
whilst the period also saw the conversion of 21st Bn into 21 Para (Special Forces) and the 115
Infantry battalion (TA) being grouped under the MAHAR Regiment. The five Mahavir Chakras
and the numerous other war and peace time gallantry awards bear testimony to the front-line
leadership and courage of the Regiment's Officers, JCOs and NCOs. Gen J.J. Singh (9th and 5th)
became the first Chief of Army Staff from the Maratha Light Infantry in Feb 2005. 2 During the
1947-48 Indo-Pak war, 3 (PARA) MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY was a part of 50 Para Brigade

On 09 January 1948, Brigadier Lakhinder Singh, MBE, commander of ‘Z’ Brigade Group, issued
instructions for opening road Naushera-excluding Seri. The road was cleared by 10 January
without meeting opposition from the enemy. After the failure of his attack on Naushahra on 06
January and his failure to keep the vital road Naushera-Beri Pattan closed to traffic, the enemy
confined his activities to sniping and light patrolling, while carrying out the re-organisation of his
forces for another major trial of strength. Indian forces too re-organised and confined their
activities to light patrolling as a prelude to an attack on the strong enemy defensive position at Kot
on 01 February. On 15 January, Z Brigade less 1/9 Gorkha Rifles, 3 (PARA) Mahratta Light
Infantry and 22 Field Company RIE pulled out of Naushera, as the imminent threat to Naushera
had been removed.

of 3 (PARA) MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY tasked to reinforce the affected Company. He
helped to relieving the intensity of enemy fire. After the systematic withdrawal of rest of the
Battalion, when it was his Company’s turn to withdraw, the enemy fire intensified. The route of
withdrawal was covered by heavy enemy fire. A sepoy was hurt and left behind while crossing the
area of the ground that was the most vulnerable. Despite knowing the magnitude of the dangers
involved, Major Annavi Krishnaswamy Ramaswamy raced back to save the injured sepoy. The
wounded sepoy gallantly warned the officer to not come foe his rescue. Undaunted, the officer
hurried to the injured soldier's aid and, despite being shot at by the enemy, managed to drag him

district of Nepal. He enrolled in the prestigious 3/1 Gorkha Rifles of the Indian Army on 3
December 1942.
The first battalion of the Gorkha Regiment was raised in April 1815, after the Anglo-Nepalese
War. At the time of Indian independence in 1947, 3/1Gorkha Rifles was transferred to the Indian
Army as part of the Tripartite Agreement signed between India, Nepal and Britain. Prior to
independence, the regiment was known as the 3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles. In
1950, the regiment's title was changed to 3 Gorkha Rifles. Since 1947, the regiment has
participated in a number of wars and conflict situations including the 1947-48 and 1971 wars
between India and Pakistan. The regiment has five battalions – 1/1 GR, 2/1 GR, 3/1 GR, 4/1 GR
and 5/1 GR. 3/1 GR was part of the 99 Infantry Brigade Group which marked Indian presence in
the United Nations Peacekeeping operation called the Opération des Nations Unies au Congo
(ONUC) in 1961-62. The battalion’s motto is “Kayar Hunu Bhanda Marnu Ramro” (Better to
die than live like a coward).
The Republic of Congo (now Democratic Republic of Congo) gained independence from its
colonial master, Belgium, in 1960. However, the newly independent nation soon descended into
a series of conflicts. The Congolese government appealed to the United Nations (UN) for aid and
assistance of a multilateral force to contain the violence and maintain peace in the strife-torn
country. The ONUC was established on 14 July 1960 under the United Nations Security Council
Resolution 143. The initial mandate of ONUC was to ensure the withdrawal of Belgian forces
from the Republic of the Congo, assist the Congolese government in maintaining law and order,
and provide technical assistance. Subsequently, ONUC became embroiled in a chaotic internal
situation of extreme complexity and had to be converted into an UN peacekeeping operation
which allowed limited use of military force. The Force was designed to protect the Congo from
outside interference, particularly by evacuating foreign mercenaries and advisers from Katanga
and preventing clashes and civil strife, by force, if necessary, as a last resort. In 1961-62,
secessionist gendarmes under the command of foreign mercenaries clashed with the UN Force.
At its peak, ONUC had 20,000 troops, including a brigade from India. In February 1963, after
Katanga had been reintegrated into the national territory of Congo, ONUC began to be phased
out. It was finally dissolved on 30 June 1964.
2On 16 September 1961, Naik Mahabir Thapa was commanding a section of the rear-guard
platoon of the relief force that was withdrawing from Lufira Bridge. His platoon was tasked to
prevent the enemy from closing on the withdrawing force. During the action, Naik Thapa had
been wounded even before he reached the road block. However, he deployed his section boldly
and engaged the enemy with fire while maneuvering towards flank of the enemy ambush. In
doing so, he was severely wounded by an enemy machine gun fire. Undeterred by the injuries, he
continued to lead his section and engaged the enemy fiercely. Naik Thapa’s section withdrew
only after every one of the retreating forces had safely crossed the ambushed area. He was the
last man to leave the area and shortly afterwards he succumbed to his injuries.
Naik Mahabir Thapa was awarded nation’s second highest gallantry award Maha Vir Chakra for
showing leadership and courage of highest order, posthumously.1

was recruited into the Ladakhi Battalion of 14 J&K Militia. By the year 1962, Subedar Stopdan
Sonam had put in substantial years of service and developed into a motivated and dependable
Junior Commissioned Officer. His unit 14 J&K Militia was deployed in Ladakh along the China

formed of Ladakhi locals known as Nubra Guards to save Ladakh from intruders in 1948. It
comprised of Ladakhi locals who are physically fit and attuned with the rugged terrain and hostile
climate. The Ladakh Scouts was raised in 1963, following the Indo China War of 1962. It had two

Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China since both the countries
shared political, geographical and cultural similarities. Therefore, soon after its establishment on
01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant diplomatic status to the People’s
Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state recognition of PRC on various
international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into negotiations with China on the
question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement in 1954. Within a few weeks of Chou
Enlai’s visit to India, the Chinese launched a protest against the presence of Indian troops in
Barahoti, three kilometers South of a border pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the first
time, the Government of China laid claim to any part of Indian territory formally. The construction
of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957, marked a turning point in the Sino-India relations as the
Chinese occupied a large part of the Aksai Plateau. This opened an opportunity for China to come
out with territorial claims against India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved in further into
Ladakh and established themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal, just South of Dambu
Guru. On 08 September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Post in the Eastern

went on to Yarkand in Sinkiang. The other two routes connected DBO to Leh, over 200 kilometres
away, and requiring at least twelve days of long and difficult marching to reach it. Th Eastern or

10 to 15). These Posts were dependent upon DBO for their supply. All the Posts were equipped
only with small arms with the exception of Post 1 that had a Section of 3-inch mortars. The Posts
thus were not in a position to dominate more than 500 meters distance around them, this being the
effective range of the Light Machine Guns. average distance between the Posts was 2 to 3 kms and
some like Post 14 were nearly 10 to 12 kms away from nearest Indian Posts. There was thus no
possibility of mutual support.
The Chinese had been building up their strength In the Sector from July 1962 onwards. The vicinity
of Indian Post No 4 enabled them to bring in their heavy weapons very close to our posts. On 19
October 1962, all the Indian Posts near Chip Chap were dominated by the Chinese in superior
strength.

5 JAT located on the Northern bank of Chip Chap River and the personnel of these two Posts were
asked to fall back on Post 4. Post 1 (Chandani) manned by a Platoon of 14 J&K Militia, was now
isolated. This Post was well sited on high ground and was not easy to assault. On 20 October at
0600 hours Chinese commenced shelling Post 1. The bombardment continued for nearly one hour.
After this the post was attacked by the Chinese, the Commander at DBO attempted to send
reinforcements to it, but the Chinese, who had by then occupied Post 5, which effectively
dominated the route, made it impossible.
On the night of 19/20 October, during the battle of Post 1 (Chandani Post), Subedar Sonam Stopdan
who was Commander of the Post put up a gallant fight and displayed inspiring leadership. He and
his men fought to the last and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. Finally, after resisting
attacks by the Chinese in strength Post 1 fell. The fall of Post 1 had opened up the North Eastern,
approach to DBO. The local Commander then sent two small patrols to occupy Point 18029 and
Point 17911. Post 4 continued to hold in spite of incessant shelling. The situation at the end of the
first day was that while the Chinese had gained important successes by eliminating Posts 1 and 9,
the other Posts continued to resist.
In the battles of Daulat Beg Oldi Sub Sector, Indian troops fought valiantly despite having scarcity
of resources and being outnumbered by the Chinese troops. In the fight of Post 1 (Chandani) or
Post 4, Subedar Sonam Stopdan and Havildar Saroop Singh of the 14 J&K Militia made the
supreme sacrifice after taking heavy toll of the enemy. Both were honored with the nation's second

radiated from it. The old Silk Route went North, crossed the Karakoram Pass (5575 meters) and
went on to Yarkand in Sinkiang. The other two routes connected DBO to Leh, over 200 kilometres
away, and requiring at least twelve days of long and difficult marching to reach it. The Eastern or
Winter route went due South from DB0 crossing the Track Junction, Chip Chap River and the

on 19 October 1962 at 2300 hrs. Post 5 (Pramodak) was manned by fourteen Jawans under an
NCO of 14 J&K Militia. Post 9 (Bhishan) was held by five Jawans of 5 JAT. The Chinese subjectedboth the Posts to heavy fire from Mortars and Medium Machine Guns. Both the weapons having
longer ranges than what the Indians had, the Chinese could remain out of range of Indian: fire. The
Indian defences were merely open trenches and Sangars (stone heaps above ground level) as
digging into the frozen soil was difficult and there was no stores for construction of overhead cover
to protect the Jawans from the splinter effects of the Mortar and Artillery bombardment. Both the
Posts were: constantly in touch with the Commander at DBO, Major Shardul Singh Randhawa. It
is estimated that the Chinese attacked Post 5 with nearly two Companies and Post 9 with a
Company. The Posts continued to resist the Chinese till first light on 20 October, when both the
Posts went out of communications with the Headquarters. There were very few survivors. The

Later in the year 1961, as years of negotiation did not yield any result, the Indian
government decided to deploy the Armed Forces in an effort to evict the Portuguese out
of Goa and other Enclaves. Consequently ""Op Vijay"" was launched in December 1961 and
Major Chaudhary was part of that operation. By 1962, he had served for nearly six years
with his unit in different field locations and had developed into a tough soldier and fine
officer with commendable leadership skills.
The PUNJAB Regiment, is amongst the oldest Regiments in the Indian Army and traces its
origins back to 1805 when the First Battalion was raised under the Maharaja of Patiala.
Originally, the Regiment comprised four British-raised Battalions. The numbers and titles of
the Battalions changed during the successive reorganisations of the Madras Presidency Army,
the British Indian Army and the Indian Army during 18th, 19th and 20th Century. After the 1857,
the British applied the martial races theory and North Indian troops replaced the South Indians.Post Independence, the PUNJAB Regiment of India was formed from the 2nd Punjab Regiment
of the British Indian Army. In 1951, four battle experienced Battalions of the former Princely
states of Punjab, joined the Regiment. These Battalions were from the Jind and Nabha State
Forces and the first and second Battalions of Patiala Infantry. They were designated as the 13th,
14th, 15th and 16th battalions of the PUNJAB Regiment. Additional Battalions have been
raised since 1963. Since 1947, the PUNJAB Regiment has taken part in various battle sand
wars, winning numerous honours and awards for the same. The Regimental Centre of the
Regiment was first raised at Loralai and was shifted to Multan in 1922, Meerut in 1929 and at
last to its present location in Ramgarh, Jharkhand in 1976.1 During the Sino-India war of 1962,
the Regiment was deployed in the North-East Frontier Agency Sector (NEFA) as part of 7
Infantry Brigade of 4 Infantry Division and fought valiantly in the crucial battles in Namka
Chu Sector.
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with

During the 1962 Sino-India War, the North East Frontier Agency (NEFA) was a hub of enemy
invasions. In early September, the Government of India ordered immediate evacuation of
enemy troops from the NEFA. On 24 September Lieutenant General Umrao Singh, who was
the Corps Commander conveyed the orders to Major General Niranjan Prasad, GOC 4 Infantry
Division who then made sure that the energies of Indian Army in the area was directed to
execute “OPERATION LEGHORN”. Brigadier JP Dalvi, who was the Commander of the 7
Infantry Brigade, along with Major General Niranjan Prasad prepared a plan with a modest aim
of capturing a small feature on Thag La slopes, and Tseng-Jong, then roll down West to East
to the Chinese positions on the Namka Chu. However soon the responsibility of NEFA was
handed over to IV CORPS commanded by Lieutenant General B M Kaul, the CGS. Acting
upon the Brigadier Dalvi’s plan for Op LEGHORN, on 08 October Lieutenant General Kaul
began his opening moves by ordering 2 RAJPUT and 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES down from
Tsangdhar to join other troops along the river line. Both the Battalions reached the river line
on 09 October 1962.
The plan was to evict the Chinese from Thag La"" by 7 Infantry Brigade. Thag La Peak, was
where they would take positions behind and dominating the Chinese, as the Chinese had not
yet occupied it. Lieutenant General Kaul chose the approach through Tseng- Jong which would
be occupied by 9 PUNJAB. One Platoon of 'D' Company 9 PUNJAB, under MajorM S.Chaudhary left for Tseng-Jong and established Bridgehead on the North Bank of Namkha

Although Chinese response to these moves didn’t come instantly, but a strong Chinese response
came on 10 October 1962. When groups of men from 2 RAJPUT were moving up the Southern
Bank of the Namkha Chu, making for Bridge III on their way to Log Bridge - the planned
crossing point on the way to Yutso La - a full Battalion of Chinese emerged from their positions
and moved quickly down the Ridge, to form up for an attack on, Tseng-Jong. At the same time
the Indian position at Tseng-Jong came under fire from heavy mortars. At around 0800 hours
approximately 800 Chinese attacked the 9 PUNJAB position at Tseng-Jong from the East and
North-East. After a heavy exchange of fire for about 45 minutes, the attack was repulsed.
However, the enemy soon re-formed for a second time and started assaulting the position at
around 0930 Hours. A Section of 9 PUNJAB under Havildar Malkiat Singh on Karpola II had
moved close to the flank of the Chinese. The Section opened fire on the Chinese and completely
surprised them. While the Chinese were caught in the cross-fire of Light Machine Guns and
suffered heavy casualties, they reacted and opened Heavy Mortar fire on the Section. The
Section was subsequently asked to withdraw.
Major Mahandar Singh Chaudhary contacted his Battalion Commander Lieutenant Colonel R
N Misra, on wireless and informed him that, as the enemy was forming up again, it would be
difficult for his men to hold the ground unless supported by Medium Machine Guns and
Mortars from Bridge 4. Colonel Misra agreed to give fire support, but it was turned down byBrigadier Dalvi after consultations with Divisional and Corps Commanders. Brigadier Dalvi
informed the Battalion Commander that reinforcements from 2 RAJPUT were already on the
way.
The enemy assaulted the position a third time at 1200 hours from three sides- North, East and
West, with 82 mm Mortars mm mortars, automatic weapons. Hand to hand fighting developed.
Major M S Chaudhary insufficient time to dig in and coordinate the defences, he stood his
ground with the small arms ammunition at his disposal and kept the enemy at bay for more
than nine hours. Realising that the platoon at Tseng-Jong was no more position to hold the
ground, at around 1250 hours the Brigade Commander issued the withdrawal order. After
which Major M S Chaudhary was ordered to withdraw South of the Log Bridge which he did
successfully. Although he was wounded, he refused to be evacuated and continued to be a
source of great inspiration to his men. throughout this and in the subsequent operations of 20
October 1962. In the latter battle, he inflicted some 100 casualties on the enemy. However,
during the war, he went missing in action. For his determination and grit, he was awarded Maha

4000 Parvat, Nepal. He joined the Indian Army on 30 December 1943 at the age of eighteen
and was recruited into 1/8 GORKHA RIFLES, a regiment known for its fearless soldiers and
numerous battle exploits. Lance Naik Thapa after completing his training served in various
operational areas including Sino India War of 1962. He was awarded second highest gallantry
award Maha Vir Chakra for the display of conspicuous courage and devotion to duty in the
battle of Sirijap Post in Ladakh sector. Later, Naik Rabi Thapa was promoted to the rank of
Naib Subedar.
The first battalion of Gurkha Regiment (now Gorkha Rifles) was raised in 1815 during the
Anglo-Nepalese war. Impressed by the qualities displayed by Gurkhas during the war, the
British started active recruitment of Gurkhas into the British Indian army. After the partition,
in 1947 six Gurkha regiments viz, 1 GR, 3 GR, 4 GR, 5 GR, 8 GR and 9 GR remained with
the Indian Army, while 2 GR, 6 GR, 7 GR and 10 GR were transferred to British Army as
part of the Tripartite Agreement signed between India, Nepal and Britain. The 8 GR was
raised in 1824 as a part of British East Indian Company and later was transferred to British
Indian Army after the First War of Independence of 1857. The regiment participated in
World War I and World War II. Since independence, the regiment has proved its mettle in
Sino-India War of 1962 and Indo-Pak War of 1971. The regiment’s motto is ‘Kafar Hunu
Bhanda Marnu Ramro’ (Better to die than live like a coward). The regiment has given India
one of the two Field Marshals, Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, of the Indian Army. The
battalion was subsequently mechanised and later re-designated as 3 MECHANISED
INFANTRY.
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after
its establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant
diplomatic status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of
state recognition of PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter
into negotiations with China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel
Agreement in 1954. Within a few weeks of Chou Enlai’s visit to India in 1954, the Chinese
launched a protest against the presence of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometers south of
a border pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the first time, the Government of China
laid claim to any part of Indian territory formally. The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang
Road in 1957 marked a turning point in the Sino-India relations as the Chinese occupied a
large part of the Aksai Chin. This opened an opportunity for China to come out with
territorial claims against India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved in further into
Ladakh and established themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal, just south of
Dambu Guru. On 08 September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Post in
the Eastern sector and began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in the Easternsector in Namka Chu sector as well as in the Western sector in Ladakh. The overwhelming
number of the Chinese troops attacked the Indian soldiers but they fought the enemy with grit
and determination. The Chinese announced the cease-fire at midnight of 21/22 November

Ladakh, a part of frontier province of Jammu and Kashmir, is also part of the Greater
Himalayan Range. The mountains of Ladakh, perhaps the most rugged and inhospitable in
the world are formidable. On the night of 19/20 October 1962, the Chinese forces attacked
Chip-Chap, Galwan and Pangong area of Ladakh. Despite the fact that these posts were
isolated and lacked fire support, the Indian Army fought bravely but was overrun by the
enemy who was superior in numbers.

During the war, Chinese aimed to capture Chushul airfield, which was the lifeline to the
Indian Air Force in the area. To prevent this, 1/8 GORKHA RIFLES was deployed in the
area. One of the posts in this area, the Sirijap Post was unexpectedly subjected to severe
mortar and artillery fire from the Chinese on 21 October, 1962. The post lost contact with the
base due to the broken wireless equipment. Naik Rabi Lal Thapa, who was commander of
another post, offered to take a storm boat to the Sirijap Post to conduct reconnaissance and
bring back the most recent situation report. When he was about 1,000 yards from the post, the
enemy noticed him and opened fire on the boat from three different directions.Naik Rabi Lal Thapa commander of a post in the Pangong Lake area of Ladakh shakes hands

The Regiment of Artillery was raised on 28 September 1827. It was initially raised as Bombay
Artillery and was later renamed 5 Bombay Mountain Battery. In May 1857, the mutiny by Indian
soldiers started in the Artillery of the Army of the Bengal Presidency. The incident prompted a
complete ban on Indian Artillery units, except the Mountain Artillery Batteries in select Provinces.
The decision was reversed in the mid-1930s when the first of the Field Regiments of the Indian
Army were raised. The Field Regiments support the formations on the field. The Regimental motto

During the Sino-India War of 1962, Second Lieutenant Shyamal Dev Goswami was deployed in
Ladakh and he fought valiantly in the battle of Gurung Hill. The war in the West was fought in
Ladakh. Ladakh, a part of frontier province of Jammu and Kashmir is also part of the Greater
Himalayan Range. The mountains of Ladakh, perhaps the most rugged and inhospitable in the
world.
The fighting in Ladakh in 1962 was in three distinct phases. The first Phase began on 19 October
night when Chinese commenced their attacks against the Isolated 'Forward Policy’ Posts. This
Phase lasted till 27 October between this time and 18 November there was lull in fighting . This
period was utilized by both sides to build up their strengths, while Chinese build up was mainly
opposite Spangur Gap, the Indian side strengthened defences in the depth. In third and final Phase
the Chinese overwhelmed the Indian defences on the Eastern edge of Chushul airfield. The cease
fire was declared on of 21 November 1962, by when the Chinese had rendered the airfield unusable
for Indians.A rough map of Ladakh front in 1962 by Maj Gen Jagjit Singh.

In the early Phases of fighting in Ladakh Chushul defences were held by two Companies of 1/8
GORKHA RIFLES. After being relieved by 5 JAT in second week of October 1962, a Company
less Platoon strength was deployed in Sirijap Compex North of Pangong lake. This Post was
supplied by boats across the lake and had no land link with the Battalion. South of Pangong Lake
was the Yula Complex consisting of three Posts manned by another Company 1/8 GORKHA
RIFLES. Nearly two Companies defended the Spangur Gap. Both the hills on the Northern
Shoulder named Gurung Hill and to the South Magar Hill, were held. In addition, there was a Post
in the Gap itself.
On 18 November the Chinese attack in this Sector started, coinciding with their attack on Sela in
NEFA. The Chinese were obviously working to a timetable. Chushul with its airfield and the
Indian brigade was a thorn in the Chinese flesh as that provided a possible jump off point for an
Indian threat to the Chinese occupied Aksai Chin and the highway running through it. In fact a
cursory thought was given by the CGS to the possibility of offensive across Spangur Gap in orderto relieve pressure in the Chip Chap valley. The idea did not progress any further, as the Indians
did not have adequate strength for it.
The Chinese launched a two-pronged attack on Chushul defences. northern prong of attack and
nearly regiment strength, attacked Gurung hill. Basically, the Chinese, lower half of Black Top
Hill was under Chinese. The Chinese thus had the advantage of attacking down-hill, which always
is a major consideration in mountains. The attack on Gurung Hill posed a direct threat to Chushul
airfield.
The going for the invading Chinese was tougher at Gurung Hill. The Chinese attacked Gurung Hill
complex simultaneously with their attacked Rezangla. the approach chosen was from Black Hill,
that gave them an advantage of attacking from the ground. At 0530 Hours on 18 November, the
Chinese began intense bombardment of Gurung Hill as well as the Indian posts located in the
Spangur Gap and Magar Hill.
Two companies of 1/8 GORKHA RIFLES were defending the vast area of Gurung Hill. The troops
had well dug positions protected by wire and some Anti- personnel mines. and the attack was
expected from the direction of Black Hill; the defenses were therefore ready to face the Chinese.
The first wave of attackers made contact with the northern company of the Gurung hill at 0630
Hours. Here the Chinese were in a surprise. When still outside the small arms range, they engaged
the Chinese troops by accurate fire from the guns of 13 FIELD REGIMENT. Second Lieutenant
SD Goswami did a commendable job of directing the fire. When Second Lieutenant S.D Goswami
was wounded, Technical Assistant Gurdip Singh, though severely wounded himself, took over
command of the Post and continued to direct the fire of our Artillery on the enemy thereby
inflicting heavy casualties on them. In this action Technical Assistant Gurdip Singh displayed great
initiative and courage of a high order and was awarded Vir Chakra Posthumously.
Second Lieutenant Shyamal Dev Goswami had fell unconscious and was lying there in pain, when
the Chinese came to check the Post for survivors, they left him for dead and left the Post. The
following day, Shyamal regained consciousness and managed to descend from his position,
crawling and limping towards the emergency base camp. 2 Gorkha Soldiers noticed him and
promptly escorted him to receive medical assistance. Initially declared deceased, a surprising
movement in his body indicated otherwise. He was soon evacuated and sent to Military Hospital
in Delhi. Second Lieutenant Shyamal Dev Goswami survived and was sent to Germany for his
treatment and rehabilitation, which was funded by the Rotarian Club of India.Major Shyamal Dev Goswami after his treatment in Germany.

The brave Gorkhas were finally overwhelmed by vastly superior numbers, and the forward
Platoon fell. Out of 17 men in this Platoon the every single one died fighting the Chinese. The
Chinese launched a series of attacks and finally, after two hours, a detachment managed to occupy
some portions of Gurung Hill, the energetic Platoon Commander there, Tej Bahadur Gurung got
his men out from the trenches, and using, traditional Gorkha Khukri (a small curved knife) on the
Chinese. The Chinese had to fall back fearing this fierce onslaught. By 1000 hours the situation
stabilized and Gurung Hill remained firmly in Indian hands. In the meanwhile, Chinese were
continuously shelling the Spangur Gap as well as airfield. The track between Gurung Hill and the
Battalion Headquarters was no longer usable. The men on Gun Hill were asked to conserve their
ammunition for second attack by the Chinese, which was expected soon. The second attack was
preceded by even intense shelling.Second Lieutenant Shyamal Dev Goswami being awarded the Mahavir Chakra.

The PUNJAB Regiment, is among the oldest Regiments in the Indian Army, it traces its origins
back to 1805 when the First Battalion was raised under the Maharaja of Patiala. Originally, the
Regiment comprised four British-raised Battalions. The numbers and titles of the Battalions
changed during the successive reorganisations of the Madras Presidency Army, the British
Indian Army and the Indian Army during 18th, 19th and 20th Century. After the 1857 War of
Independence, the British applied the martial races theory and North Indian troops replaced the
South Indians. Post Independence, the PUNJAB Regiment of India was formed from the 2nd
Punjab Regiment of the British Indian Army. In 1951, four battle experienced Battalions of the
former Princely states of Punjab, joined the Regiment. These battalions were from the Jind and
Nabha State Forces and the first and second Battalions of Patiala Infantry. They were
designated as the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th battalions of the PUNJAB Regiment. Additional
Battalions have been raised since 1963. Since 1947, the PUNJAB Regiment has taken part in
various battle sand wars, winning numerous honours and awards for the same. The Regimental
Centre of the Regiment was first raised at Loralai and was shifted to Multan in 1922, Meerut

During the 1962 Sino-India War, the North East Frontier Agency (NEFA) was a hub of enemy
invasions. In early September, the Government of India ordered immediate evacuation of
enemy troops from the NEFA. On 24 September Lieutenant General Umrao Singh, who was
the Corps Commander conveyed the orders to Major General Niranjan Prasad, GOC 4 Infantry
Division who then made sure that the energies of Indian Army in the area was directed to
execute “OPERATION LEGHORN”. Brigadier JP Dalvi, who was the Commander of 7
Infantry Brigade, along with Major General Niranjan Prasad prepared a plan with a modest aim
of capturing a small feature on Thag La slopes, and Tseng-Jong, then roll down West to East
to the Chinese positions on the Namka Chu. However soon the responsibility of NEFA was
handed over to IV CORPS commanded by Lieutenant General B M Kaul, the CGS. Acting

began his opening moves by ordering 2 RAJPUTS and 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES down from
Tsangdhar to join other troops along the river line. Both the Battalions reached the river line
on 09 October 1962.
The plan was to evict the Chinese from Thag La"" by 7 Infantry Brigade. Thag La Peak, was
where they would take positions behind and dominating the Chinese, as the Chinese had not
yet occupied it. Lieutenant General Kaul chose the approach through Tseng- Jong which would
be occupied by 9 PUNJAB. One Platoon of 'D' coy 9 PUNJAB, under Major M.S.Chaudhary
left for Tseng-Jong and established a position on the North Bank of Namkha Chu. The Platoon
occupied the location at 1500 hours on 08 October. One Section of this Platoon then occupied
Karpole II height next morning. One Platoon Section of ‘A’ Coy 9 PUNJAB under Naik Chain

Although Chinese response to these moves didn’t come instantly, but a strong Chinese response
came on 10 October 1962. When groups of men from 2 RAJPUT were moving up the Southern
Bank of the Namkha Chu, making for Bridge III on their way to Log Bridge - the planned
crossing point on the way to Yutso La - a full Battalion of Chinese emerged from their positions
and moved quickly down the Ridge, to form up for an attack on, Tseng-Jong. At the same time
the Indian position at Tseng-Jong came under fire from Heavy Mortars.
Naik Chain Singh was in the Platoon position at Tseng- Jong in NEFA. Approximately 500
Chinese concentrated in the vicinity of his Post and started shelling it with guns and mortars.
Although greatly outnumbered and with limited quantity of ammunition, Naik Chain Singh andhis men inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. The Chinese then launched more determined
assault on this Post from all sides; but Naik Chain Singh and his men held on and inflicted
heavy casualties on the enemy. When he had nearly run out of ammunition, he was ordered to
withdraw his Section. Ordering his Rifle Group to withdraw, he took over the Light Machine
Gun to give covering fire to the rest of his Section. But while doing so he was hit by a burst of
enemy Machine Gun fire. Although seriously wounded, he kept on manning the Light Machine
Gun to facilitate the withdrawal of his Section. He was again hit by an enemy Machine Gun
burst in the head and killed on the spot. It was due to the exceptional courage and leadership
of Naik Chain Singh that his Section could inflict heavy casualties on the attacking Chinese

2442148,Subedar (Then Sepoy),Kanshi Ram,9 PUNJAB,"Subedar (Then Sepoy) Kanshi Ram was born on 01 July 1938, to Shri Narotam Ram who
himself had served in the Indian Army. He was born in Duhan Village in Mandi, Himachal
Pradesh. Following the footsteps of his father, he joined the same regiments as his father and
enrolled into 9 PUNJAB of the Indian Army on 18 January 1958 at the age of twenty. During
the Sino-India War of 1962, Sepoy Kanshi Ram was deployed in the NEFA Sector where
he fought the Chinese in the battle of Tseng-Jong and was awarded Maha Vir Chakra.
The PUNJAB Regiment, is amongst the oldest Regiments in the Indian Army and traces its
origins back to 1805 when the First Battalion was raised under the Maharaja of Patiala.
Originally, the Regiment comprised four British-raised Battalions. The numbers and titles of
the Battalions changed during the successive reorganisations of the Madras Presidency Army,
the British Indian Army and the Indian Army during 18th, 19th and 20th Century. After the 1857,
the British applied the martial races theory and North Indian troops replaced the South Indians.
Post Independence, the PUNJAB Regiment of India was formed from the 2nd Punjab Regiment
of the British Indian Army. In 1951, four battle experienced Battalions of the former Princely
states of Punjab, joined the Regiment. These battalions were from the Jind and Nabha State
Forces and the first and second Battalions of Patiala Infantry. They were designated as the 13th,
14th, 15th and 16th battalions of the PUNJAB Regiment. Additional Battalions have been
raised since 1963. Since 1947, the PUNJAB Regiment has taken part in various battle sand
wars, winning numerous honours and awards for the same. The Regimental Centre of the
Regiment was first raised at Loralai and was shifted to Multan in 1922, Meerut in 1929 and at
last to its present location in Ramgarh, Jharkhand in 1976.1 During the Sino-India war of 1962,
the Regiment was deployed in the North-East Frontier Agency Sector (NEFA) as part of 7
Infantry Brigade of 4 Infantry Division and fought valiantly in the crucial battles in Namka
Chu Sector.
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after
its establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant
diplomatic status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state
recognition of PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into
negotiations with China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement
in 1954. Within a few weeks of Chou Enlai’s visit to India in 1954, the Chinese launched a
protest against the presence of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometers South of a Border
Pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the first time, the Government of China laid claim
to any part of Indian territory formally. The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957
marked a turning point in the Sino-India relations as the Chinese occupied a large part of the
Aksai Chin. This opened an opportunity for China to come out with territorial claims against

(2013)India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved in further into Ladakh and established
themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal, just South of Dambu Guru. On 08
September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Post in the Eastern Sector and
began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in the Eastern Sector in Namka Chu
Sector as well as in the Western Sector in Ladakh. The overwhelming number of the Chinese
troops attacked the Indian soldiers but they fought the enemy with grit and determination. The
Chinese announced the cease-fire at midnight of 21/22 November 1962.2

During the 1962 Sino-India War, the North East Frontier Agency (NEFA) was a hub of enemy
invasions. In early September, the Government of India ordered immediate evacuation of
enemy troops from the NEFA. On 24 September Lieutenant General Umrao Singh, who was
the Corps Commander conveyed the orders to Major General Niranjan Prasad, GOC 4 Infantry
Division who then made sure that the energies of Indian Army in the area was directed to
execute “OPERATION LEGHORN”. Brigadier JP Dalvi, who was the Commander of the 7
Infantry Brigade, along with Major General Niranjan Prasad prepared a plan with a modest aim
of capturing a small feature on Thag La slopes, and Tseng-Jong, then roll down West to East
to the Chinese positions on the Namka Chu. However soon the responsibility of NEFA was

upon the Brigadier Dalvi’s plan for Op LEGHORN, on 08 October Lieutenant General Kaul
began his opening moves by ordering 2 RAJPUT and 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES down from
Tsangdhar to join other troops along the river line. Both the Battalions reached the river line
on 09 October 1962.
The plan was to evict the Chinese from Thag La"" by 7 Infantry Brigade. Thag La Peak, was
where they would take positions behind and dominating the Chinese, as the Chinese had not
yet occupied it. Lieutenant General Kaul chose the approach through Tseng- Jong which would
be occupied by 9 PUNJAB. One Platoon of 'D' Company 9 PUNJAB, under Major M S
Chaudhary left for Tseng-Jong and established a Bridgehead on the North Bank of Namkha
Chu. The Platoon occupied a location at 1500 hours on 08 October. One Section of this Platoon
then occupied Karpole II height next morning. One Platoon Section of ‘A’ Company 9
PUNJAB then left to for Tseng-Jong to reinforce Major Chaudhary’s Platoon on 09 October
1962.

Although Chinese response to these moves didn’t come instantly, but a strong Chinese response
came on 10 October 1962. When groups of men from 2 RAJPUT were moving up the Southern
Bank of the Namkha Chu, making for Bridge III on their way to Log Bridge - the planned
crossing point on the way to Yutso La - a full Battalion of Chinese emerged from their positions
and moved quickly down the Ridge, to form up for an attack on, Tseng-Jong. At the same time
the Indian position at Tseng-Jong came under fire from heavy mortars. At around 0800 hours
approximately 800 Chinese attacked the 9 PUNJAB position at Tseng-Jong from the East and
North-East. After a heavy exchange of fire for about 45 minutes, the attack was repulsed.However, the enemy soon re-formed for a second time and started assaulting the position at
around 0930 Hours. A Section of 9 PUNJAB under Havildar Malkiat Singh on Karpola II had
moved close to the flank of the Chinese. The Section opened fire on the Chinese and completely
surprised them. While the Chinese were caught in the cross-fire of Light Machine Guns and
suffered heavy casualties, they reacted and opened Heavy Mortar fire on the Section. The
Section was subsequently asked to withdraw.
Major Mahandar Singh Chaudhary contacted his Battalion Commander Lieutenant Colonel
R N Misra, on wireless and informed him that, as the enemy was forming up again, it would
be difficult for his men to hold the ground unless supported by Medium Machine Guns and
mortars from Bridge 4. Colonel Misra agreed to give fire support, but it was turned down by
Brigadier Dalvi after consultations with the Divisional and Corps Commanders. Brigadier
Dalvi Informed the Battalion Commander that reinforcements from 2 RAJPUT were already
on the way.
On 10 October 1962, the Post at Tsen-Jong where Sepoy Kanshi Ram was deployed, was
attacked by approximately 500 Chinese soldiers. Disregarding the heavy enemy fire, he
covered the right approach to this Post with his Light Machine Gun and inflicted heavy
casualties on the Chinese. In the process he himself was seriously wounded. Though profusely
bleeding he refused to be evacuated. The Post was again assaulted by the enemy for the third
time at 1200 hours from three sides- North, East and West, with 82 mm Mortars mm mortars,
automatic weapons. Despite his injury, Sepoy Kanshi Ram brought his gun into action. The
enemy waves kept on advancing and closing in on the Post. A Chinese officer along with four
other ranks approached close to Sepoy Kanshi Ram and shouted to his men in the trench to
surrender. Sepoy Kansi Ram shouted back at them to surrender. By this time, his ammunition
was nearly finished, but he hurled grenade and killed the enemy officer and three other ranks.
In the meantime, other Chinese soldiers closed in on him and one of them tried to snatch away
his Light Machine Gun, while another fired an automatic rifle at him wounding him again.
Despite his injuries, he held onto his gun and pushed the Chinese so skilfully that they fell
down. Sepoy Kanshi Ram then grabbed loaded automatic rifle from the enemy and came back
to his Platoon with this rifle, as well as his own Light Machine Gun. This was the first Chinese
weapon captured by 7 Infantry Brigade. In this action, Sepoy Kanshi Ram displayed
indomitable courage, initiative and resourcefulness of a high order. For his exceptional bravery

The Garhwal Rifles is a rifle regiment of the Indian Army. It was originally raised as the 39th
Garhwal Rifles of the Bengal Army, became part of the British Indian Army, and received its
present name on India's independence. On 05 May 1887, the first battalion was raised under the
command of Lieutenant Colonel EP Mainwaring at Almora. On 04 November 1887 this battalion
reached Kalundanda in Garhwal and in 1890 Kalundanda was renamed as Lansdowne. During the
First World War, the Garhwal Rifles were involved in the trench warfare and fought gallantly
where Naik Darwan Singh Negi and Rifleman Gabar Singh Negi were both awarded Victoria
Cross, and earned many awards for gallantry. The Garhwal Rifles received the rare honour of being
conferred with the ‘Royal’ title which was made official on 02 February 1921. The regiment also
fought during the Second World War and saw active service in almost all the theatres of the war.Post-independence the regiment was transferred to the Indian Army. and took part in the 1962
India-China War, 1965 and 1971 India-Pakistan Wars and the Kargil War of 1999.
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with

On 09 September 1962, India's then-Defense Minister Krishna Menon decided to evict the Chinese
troops stationed South of Thagla Ridge due to the increasing intensity of Chinese incursions into
Indian Territory. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's then Prime Minister, who was in London
for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, agreed with this decision. The 7 Infantry
Brigade commanded by Brigadier JP Dalvi was then given the order to advance to Namka Chu,
which was considered as an advantageous ground for the Chinese. Being aware of this advantage,
Chinese attacked the Indian Post at Namka Chu on 20 October 1962 with overwhelming strength.
The Indian Army fought the assault but were soon overpowered by enemy’s strength in number
and superior weapons.
On the. eve of their attack on 19-20 October night, the Chinese had about four Battalions South of
the Thag La Ridge and two Companies in the vicinity of Khinzemane. They had also moved a
Battalion to Shao and nearly another battalion to the subsidiary passes between Thag La and
Karpola II. The Chinese were also holding the rear positions between Thag La and Marmang In
depth. By 20 October, the Chinese had built up their strength to an estimated one Division in the
Thag La and Khinzemane areas. It was also reported that they had positioned an additionalDivision in Bum La area. They had access to three routes (tracks) to reach Tawang. The rapid and
heavy build-up of the Chinese troops, armed with heavy mortars and Machine Guns and equipped
with modern entrenching tools, had forced the Indian Government to postpone the operation to
evict the Chinese from their illegal encroachment, North of the Namka Chu. It was felt that the
task would, for the time being, have to be limited to holding the Namka Chu.
After the Indian troops vacated Tawang on 23 October 1962, the Chinese occupied it. Chinese
stopped their push North of Tawang Chu. There was then a lull in fighting in Kameng which lasted
a little over three weeks. The period of lull was utilised by the invaders in making preparations for
further thrust into Indian territory beyond Tawang. The battalion, which covered the withdrawal
the Tawang garrison across the Tawang Chu had suffered from confusion and disorder on reaching
south of the river. As a result, many of its troops southward towards Se La in what appeared to be
a state of demoralisation. But they were halted, grouped together and the situation was stabilised.
They then occupied delaying positions at Jang where they battled with the Chinese, inflicted
casualties on the enemy and when the defence of the Bridge 4 over Tawang Chhu became
untenable they, as per plan, got it demolished on 24 October 1962.
As it appeared that the Chinese had no intention to continue further advance, the battalion was to
be prepared to stay for the on-coming winter in its Delaying Position. The Garhwalis thus settled
down in the Nuranang area to perform their duties as covering troops for main defences of 62 Bde
sector. They were to hold the area. During the period 24 October - 16 November 1962; 4
GARHWAL RIFLES carried out aggressive patrolling in this land. They harassed enemy on the
other side of the river by directing Howitzer shelling on their concentrations.
In the morning around 1000 Hrs on 16 November; A patrol led by Jemadar Partap Singh Rawat,
Platoon Commander of ‘A’ Coy which was occupying the forwardmost position in the 4
GARWAL defended area, reported heavy enemy concentration in area Lhau across the Tawang
Chu. The patrol also reported, at 1800 Hrs, that enemy was constructing a bridge over the river
near the old Bridge 4 which was demolished earlier. At about 0500 his on 17 November, Jemadar
Gabar Singh Rawat, who was defending the right forward point of ‘A' Coy, was informed by his
Observation Post that some men were advancing the road towards the defences. At about the same
time, noise of mine explosion was heard from the west flank of the company. It became clear that
the Chinese were launching an attack. Jemadar Rawat and his party lobbed a few grenades on the
approaching enemy, and made their way back to the Company under covering fire from the
forward defended localities. The Chinese were now moving towards the defences, and attacked in
a series of waves for about 30 minutes under cover of mortar fire. There attacks were beaten back
with heavy casualties to the enemy. The enemy was then seen withdrawing the rear, possibly to
reorganise the situation.On 17 November, the enemy launched fresh attack at about 0745 hrs. This time, the attack was
preceded by heavy mortar and artillery fire. Centre and Right flank of the Garhwalis came under
heavy pressure. It was again mainly due to the hand grenades, that the enemy attack was broken
up. This assault lasted for about twenty minutes. Having failed, the enemy withdrew again, leaving
more casualties in front. The enemy having regrouped and reorganised, again launched assault on
‘A’ Company locality at 0910 Hrs. The battalion successfully repulsed the enemy attack again,
inflicting heavy casualties. As the ‘A’ Coy of the battalion occupied the forward-most location of
the battalion defended area, the enemy could not attack other Coy's locations over-running 'A' Coy
first. The Chinese once again formed up and launched their most determined attack from three
directions; front and both the flanks preceded by very heavy shelling, at 1055 Hrs. The attackers
came very close to the forward trenches of the front Platoon. Naik Ranjeet Singh Gusain, seeing
an imminent danger, came out of his bunker to an open trench, and threw hand grenades very
effectively on the assaulting enemy.
The enemy managed to bring forward and site a Medium Machine Gun within thirty meters to the
left flank of the Indian position, and simultaneously continued attacking in wave after wave. The
‘A’ Coy Cmdr sent Lance Naik Trilok Singh Negi, Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat and Rifleman
Gopal Singh Gusain, who volunteered to destroy the MMG. Under cover of boulders, scraggy
bushes and trees and under the risk of their own as well as heavy enemy fire, they crawled forward
and reached to within 10 to 15 yards of target. While the Lance Naik undertook covering fire with
his Sten gun. Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat and the other rifleman hurled grenades on the enemy
MMG. The grenades exploded and without losing time both of them rushed towards the MMG
position They saw two Chinese lying dead and another, though badly wounded, still holding the
MMG. They jumped on him and overpowered him. Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat snatched the
MMG and both of them returned to their own position under the covering fire provided by the
Lance Naik. As they were entering their trenches, the enemy opened automatic fire from close
range. Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat was hit on the head and died on the spot. still holding the
MMG in his hand. The other rifleman though badly wounded, managed to cutter the trench and
was saved. In the battle of Nuranang, the Garhwalis, fought very bravely and earned acclaim. The
exceptional courage and initiative shown by Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat in the face of intense
enemy fire were in the best traditions of our Army.

contemplating retreat, Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat, on the other hand, refused to give up his
post.

illusion of a full-scale Indian battalion was present. By the time he was done, apparently, 300
Chinese soldiers were dead. Sela was killed by a grenade, and Nura was captured; when Rawat

IC-11137,Lieutenant,Ved Prakash Trehan,4 Rajputana Rifles,"Lieutenant Ved Prakash Trehan was born in Gurdaspur district of Punjab on 14 December 1937.
He was commissioned into the Rajputana Rifles of the Indian Army on 14 December 1958.
The Rajputana Rifles was raised in 1921 as 6th Rajputana Rifles following the merger of six British
Indian army regiments. In 1945 the numeral sign “6” was dropped and it became the Rajputana
Rifles. It is India’s first rifle regiment. A rifle regiment is so called because all infantry troops in
the regiment were armed with rifles. This was at a time when most soldiers fought with muskets
or swords. The soldiers of a rifle regiment were known as riflemen. The area of Rajputana
comprises of more than 20 princely states, notably Bikaner, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur, and Ajmer,
during the British rule. All these states merged with the Indian Union following independence in
1947. The Regiment has a fair combination of Jat and Rajput. The battle cry of the Rajputana
Rifles is “Raja Ramchandra ki Jai” (Hail Lord Rama). 4 RAJ RIF was part of 99 Infantry Brigade
Group in ONUC from 1961-63.
The Republic of Congo (now Democratic Republic of Congo) gained independence from its
colonial master, Belgium, in 1960. However, the newly independent nation soon descended into a
series of conflicts. The Congolese government appealed to the United Nations (UN) for aid and
assistance of a multilateral force to contain the violence and maintain peace in the strife-torn
country. The ONUC was established on 14 July 1960 under the United Nations Security Council
Resolution 143. The initial mandate of ONUC was to ensure the withdrawal of Belgian forces
from the Republic of the Congo, assist the Congolese government in maintaining law and order,
and provide technical assistance. Subsequently, ONUC became embroiled in a chaotic internal
situation of extreme complexity and had to be converted into an UN peacekeeping operation which
allowed limited use of military force. The Force was designed to protect the Congo from outside
interference, particularly by evacuating foreign mercenaries and advisers from Katanga and
preventing clashes and civil strife, by force, if necessary, as a last resort. In 1961-62, secessionist
gendarmes under the command of foreign mercenaries clashed with the UN Force. At its peak,
ONUC had 20,000 troops, including a brigade from India. In February 1963, after Katanga had
been reintegrated into the national territory of Congo, ONUC began to be phased out. It was finally
dissolved on 30 June 1964.
2On 29 December 1962, Lieutenant Trehan was leading a patrol that pushed forward through dense
jungle and reached about 100 meters from the enemy trenches. Here he came under intense
machine gun and rifle fire. Trying to maneuver to the right flank, the patrol encountered heavy fire
in that direction also. The encirclement of the patrol was near complete. Seeking a breakthrough,
and completely unmindful of his personal safety, he charged the many enemy positions with
determination and in a closely fought battle at close range, extricated the patrol and fulfilled the
task assigned to him. He was mortally wounded in this bold action.
Lt. Ved Prakash Trehan received a Maha Vir Chakra for his bold leadership, raw grit and courage
in the true traditions of the Indian Army. He was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, posthumously.1

(Effective date of award – 29th December 1962.)
On 29th December 1962, Lieutenant Ved Prakash Trehan was in command of a special patrol prior
to an attack by the Fourth Battalion of the Rajputana Rifles on an enemy position at a road junction
in Congo. The officer was given the task of locating and drawing fire from this strongly held enemy
position. He was also directed to take deceptive measures to mislead the enemy about the direction
of the Battalion’s attack.
Lieutenant Trehan pushed forward with his patrol through dense jungle and reached about 100
wards from the enemy trenches, where he came under intense machine gun and rifle fire. Trying
to maneuver to the right flank, the patrol came under heavy enemy fire from that direction also.
Realizing that the patrol was being surrounded he charged the enemy positions with great
determination and silenced them. He thus extricated his patrol and fulfilled the task assigned to
him but was mortally wounded and killed in the action.
The supreme sacrifice and devotion to duty displayed by Lieutenant Ved Prakash Trehan were in

IC-13176,Second Lieutenant,Bhagwan Dutt Dogra,1/9 GORKHA RIFLES,"Second Lieutenant Bhagwan Dutt Dogra, the son of Dewan Chand was born on 25 September
1941 in Lahore, now in Pakistan. He was commissioned in 1/9 Gorkha Rifles of Indian Army
on 10 June 1962. During 1962 Sino-India war, Second Lieutenant Dogra was deployed on the
left flank of the battalion to guard the track leading to his company’s position in Namka Chu
in the Tawang Sector of NEFA. He was awarded second highest gallantry award Maha Vir
Chakra for the display of conspicuous courage and exemplary leadership in the battle of
Tsangdhar area in North East Frontier Agency (NEFA).
The first battalion of Gurkha Regiment (now Gorkha Rifles) was raised in 1815 during the
Anglo-Nepalese war. Impressed by the qualities displayed by Gurkhas during the war, the
British started active recruitment of Gurkhas into the British Indian army. After the partition,
in 1947 six Gurkha regiments viz, 1 GR, 3 GR, 4 GR, 5 GR, 8 GR and 9 GR remained with
the Indian Army, while 2 GR, 6 GR, 7 GR and 10 GR were transferred to British Army as
part of the Tripartite Agreement signed between India, Nepal and Britain. The 9 GR was
raised in 1817 at Infantry Levy at Fatehgarh as Fatehgarh Levy. In 1823, it became 63rd
Regiment a regular unit as part of the Bengal native Infantry. Following the reorganisation
after 1857, the designation was changed to 9th Bengal native Infantry with one of its
companies formed by Gorkhas and other hillmen. In 1893, the regiment became a wholly
Gorkha unit before finally designated as 9th Gorkha Rifles in 1903. The regiment fought in
Europe during World War I and in Italy and North West Frontier during World War II. Since
independence, the regiment has proved its mettle in Sino-India War of 1962 where it fought
under the most demanding conditions on the Namka Chu in NEFA (Now Arunachal
Pradesh). Later, the Regiment was also involved in Indo-Pak War of 1965 and 1971.1 The
regiment’s motto is ‘Kafar Hunu Bhanda Marnu Ramro’ (Better to die than live like a
coward).
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China since both the
countries shared political, geographical and cultural similarities. Therefore, soon after its
establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant
diplomatic status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of
state recognition of PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter
into negotiations with China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel
Agreement in 1954. Within a few weeks of Chou Enlai visit to India, the Chinese launched a
protest against the presence of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometres south of a border
pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the first time, the Government of China laid
claim to any part of Indian Territory formally. The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road
in 1957, marked a turning point in the Sino-India relations as the Chinese occupied a large
1

(2013)part of the Aksai plateau. This opened an opportunity for China to come out with territorial
claims against India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved in further into Ladakh and
established themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal, just south of Dambu Guru. On
08 September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Post in the Eastern sector
and began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in the Western sector in Namka
Chu sector as well as in Ladakh. The overwhelming number of the Chinese troops hit the
Indian soldiers but they fought the enemy with grit and determination. The Chinese
announced the cease-fire at midnight of 21/22 November 1962.2
On 09 September 1962, India's then-Defence Minister Krishna Menon decided to evict the
Chinese troops stationed South of Thagla Ridge due to the increasing intensity of Chinese
incursions into Indian territory. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's then Prime Minister,
who was in London for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, agreed with this
decision. The 7 Infantry Brigade was then given the order to advance to Namka Chu, which
was considered as an advantageous ground for the Chinese. Being aware of this advantage,
Chinese attacked the Indian post at Namka Chu on 20 October 1962 with overwhelming
strength. The Indian Army fought the assault but was soon overpowered by enemy’s strength
in number and superior weapons.
On the eve of their attack on the night of 19-20 October, the Chinese had about four
battalions South of Thag La Ridge and two coys in the vicinity of Khinzemane. They had
moved a battalion to Shao and another battalion to the subsidiary passes between Thag La
and Karpola II. Along with holding a rear positions between Thag La and Marmang in depth,
Chinese had also infiltrated the Tsangdhar area. Chinese had started subjecting the Indian
post at Tsangle on the north bank of Namka Chu to heavy shelling since 17 October.
However, they left this post alone in early hours of 20 October and engaged other posts all
along Namka Chu by heavy mortar fire. And between 0600 Hr and 0700 Hr they attacked
Tsangdhar area, Bridge 3 (on Namka Chu) and Dhola with aim to cut off the Indian troops.
1/9 GORKHA RIFLES was deployed to hold positions on the northern slopes of Tsangdhar
during the attack. The Gorkhas fought as hard as they could but to their surprise first they
were attacked from the flanks and later from the rear.

Chinese soldiers attacked the left flank of the position held by 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES in the
Tsangdhar area of NEFA at dawn on 20 October 1962, following a period of heavy
bombardment. On this flank, the platoon of Second Lieutenant Bhagwan Dutt Dogra was
guarding a track that led to his company's position. His platoon was attacked by no fewer
than 200 Chinese forces and came under intense fire. Second Lieutenant Dogra himself went
from bunker to bunker, inspiring confidence in his soldiers and motivating them, he
continued to do so despite being wounded in the face and bleeding profusely. Greatly
outnumbered, his men held their position and stopped the initial attack. On noticing that the
section's light machine gun had stopped firing, Second Lieutenant Dogra raced through a hail
of enemy fire with utter disregard for his personal safety, put the gun into action, and inflicted
significant damage to the enemy. He then provided cover fire for his soldiers as they
withdrew until his machine gun was destroyed and he was taken into custody.
The valiant Gorkhas stood their ground against the overwhelming strength and superior
weapons of Chinese soldiers. Second Lieutenant Bhagwan Dutt Dogra, throughout this
action, displayed exceptional bravery, leadership, and selfless devotion to duty in the best
traditions of the Army and was awarded Maha Vir Chakra for his outstanding gallantry.","Second Lieutenant Bhagwan Dutt Dogra (IC-13176) The Gorkha Rifle

IC-881,Major General (then Lieutenant Colonel),Salim Caleb,3 CAVALRY,"Major General Salim Caleb was born to Shri J Caleb on 03 November 1924 in Lahore, Pakistan.
He was commissioned into the 3 Cavalry on 02 September 1944. After partition the family settled
in Ferozpur, Punjab, and he spent his final years of life in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. Major
General Caleb was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra on 10 September 1965.
The 3 Cavalry Regiment was formed from two older Regiments, the 7th Irregular Cavalry which
was raised in 1841 at Bareilly and the 17 Cavalry which was raised at Sultanpur in 1846. In 1921,
the decision to reduce the number of cavalry regiments in India was taken, and as a result of this
39 Regular Cavalry Regiments were reorganised into 21 Regular Cavalry Regiments. 5th Bengal
Cavalry and 8th Bengal Cavalry were amalgamated and redesignated as 3 Cavalry in 1922. The
Regiment was one of the first to be Indianised in 1932 and in 1940 it shed its horses and was
mechanised and equipped with armoured cars. In World War II, it was allotted the role of
Divisional Reconnaissance Regiment of 11th Indian Division in Malaya where it fought all the
major battles of Jitra, Gurum, Kiran, Slim River, Sungei Pattani and in the Defence of Singapore.
In 1956, the Regiment converted to Centurion tanks and it with this invincible fighting machine
that it took part in the 1965 Indo-Pak War ‘Op Riddle’ at Asal Uttar, covering itself with glory.
The Battle of Asal Uttar, regarded as one of the largest tank battles in the Indo-Pakistan War of
1965, took place from 8 to 10 September 1965. During this conflict, the Pakistan Army launched
a major offensive, deploying tanks and infantry into Indian territory, resulting in the capture of the
town of Khem Karan, located approximately 5 km from the International Border. However, the
Indian troops swiftly responded, engaging in intense combat that lasted for three days. Ultimately,
the battle concluded with the Pakistani forces being decisively repelled near Asal Uttar. Several
factors contributed to this outcome, including the determined resistance exhibited by the Indian
Army, the conditions of the plains, the implementation of superior Indian tactics, and the
successful execution of a well-planned Indian strategy.""
The genesis of the Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and
Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our frontiers with Pakistan
have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing, incursions and
intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive measures. These
attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with commendable bravery and
steely resilience, but always with great restraint to not escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak war of
1965 was the second war fought between these two bordering countries. While India was still
recovering from the Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu
and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms of defence preparation. The warbegan on 24 April 1965, when the Pakistan Army attacked Indian territory in the Rann of Kutch
and penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian
territory constituted violation of the Indo-Pak Border Agreement ,1960 and the international law
as per the United Nations Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the
launch of Operation Gibraltar. The 1965 war was fought in various sectors including in Asal Uttar
under Lt Col Salim Caleb.
Asal Uttar, a village in Punjab's Tarn Taran district, bears witness to the Battle of 1965 through its
collection of memorials. These structures, both grand and modest, dot the landscape, serving as
the sole remnants of the fierce tank battle fought between Indian and Pakistani armies. Each
monument holds stories of courage, camaraderie, and sacrifice—a poignant testament to those who
defended their homeland against insurmountable odds. They stand as eternal reminders of the
legacy of the Battle of Asal Uttar, forever etched in history's pages.
The battle of Asal Uttar unfolded when Pakistani forces captured Khem Karan town, only to be
pushed back by the 4 Mountain Division and ultimately decimated by the 2nd Armoured Brigade
of the Indian Army in a decisive battle between September 08 and 10.
On 08 September, Pakistani 11 Division captured Khem Karan. 1 (Pak) Armoured Division also
started moving forward and was ready to break out. The aim behind unleashing this force was to
capture the Indian territory to the West of the Beas. According to their plan, Pakistan aimed to
capture Harike and the Beas bridges on the Beas River, and if this had been accomplished, would
have turned the defences of own 11 Corps and cut off Amritsar from rest of the country. 4
Mountain Division and 2 ( Independent) Armoured Brigade stood in their way at Asal Uttar.1
On 08 September 1965, Lieutenant Colonel Caleb, anticipating the urgency of the situation, took
the initiative to move his Regiment towards Asal Uttar even before receiving orders. Recognizing
the importance of halting Pakistan's advance and restricting their manoeuvrability, he understood
the need to confront the enemy at the earliest. Over the radio, Major PS Belvalkar, the Commander
of B Squadron of 3 Cavalry, motivated the tank crews with a resolute message: ""Press hard and
get them before they turn and run back."" The first tank Commander to destroy two Pattons in quick
succession was Dafadar Wasan Singh.
On 09 September, 1965, Lieutenant Colonel Salim Caleb engaged in deep discussions with his
Squadron Commanders, strategizing for the battle. He firmly believed that the enemy, equipped
with fresh armoured Regiments, would attempt to breach the defences of the 4 Mountain Division

was resolute that the enemy should not be allowed to expand their bridgehead beyond the Chima-
Dholan line.
His objective for the day was to maintain contact with the enemy, restrict their movement, and
channel them into predetermined areas where Indian tanks, positioned in tactically advantageous
locations, could annihilate them effectively. The ensuing action saw CQMH (Company Quarter
Master Havildar) Abdul Hamid of 4 GRENADIERS displaying extraordinary valour. Using his
106mm Recoilless Rifle (RCL) gun, he single-handedly destroyed four Patton tanks. For his brave
act, CQMH Abdul Hamid was posthumously honoured with the Param Vir Chakra. Pakistan made
no significant efforts to launch a coordinated attack or outflank Asal Uttar from the west that day,
leading to a relatively peaceful time.
On 10 September, the third day of the battle, Lieutenant Colonel Salim Caleb implemented
strategic adjustments within his Squadrons. Anticipating the Pakistan armoured columns'
desperate attempts to break through the Indian anti-tank defensive network, he devised a new
deployment plan. C Squadron, with the exception of one Troop, was positioned in the Lakhna-
Dholan and Mahmudpura area, while B Squadron secured the main axis along Chima-Dibbipura.
This defensive formation extended further North, with A Squadron, minus two Troops, stationed
at Algun, one Troop at Madar, and the fourth Troop to the North of Dibbipura.
The RHQ (Regimental Headquarters) troop took its position at the Rohi Nala Bridge on the Khem
Karan-Bhikkiwind axis. The Adjutant, Captain Dileep Kundu, was given strict instructions to
allow the enemy to cross only ""over his dead body."" Additional personnel from HQ Squadron,
including tradesmen, were mobilised to assist in various tasks, including replacing injured tank
crews. Reconnaissance Sections were deployed to cover the flanks at Lakhna and Valtoha.
Lieutenant Colonel Salim Caleb established his Tactical Headquarters at Dibbipura, from where
he oversaw and coordinated the operations.
3 Cavalry was deployed in a formation resembling two concentric semicircles or horseshoes, with
the open-end facing South towards the enemy. This meticulous plan was devised by Lieutenant
Colonel Salim Caleb, in a calm, composed, and calculated manner. In the early hours of 10
September, the Reconnaissance Section reported the movement of enemy tanks North of Bhura
Karimpur towards Dholan.
Colonel Salim Caleb's voice resonated over the radio, ""Hold fire till they are in certain killing
range."" When the enemy tank column approached within 1200 yards, the order to engage was
given. Over the next fifteen minutes, the troops executed their orders with remarkable precision,
effectively neutralising the enemy threat. Nine Patton tanks and two Recoilless Rifles (RCLs) weredestroyed, leaving the enemy helpless and unable to retaliate. The Patton were helpless and did
not even manage to get off one shot against the Indian tanks.
The enemy was so overwhelmed by the intensity of the fire from the Indian side that they
abandoned the tanks they were accompanying and hastily ran back. As darkness enveloped the
battlefield, the fighting on 10 September drew to a close. Lieutenant Colonel Salim Caleb's pivotal
decision to mobilise his Regiment and take action without waiting for official orders proved to be
one of the most significant and game-changing choices of the entire 1965 war. His swift and
resolute leadership played a decisive role in halting the enemy's advance and turning the tide of
the battle.
In recognition of his exceptional and succinct leadership, Lieutenant Colonel Salim Caleb, the
Commandant of 3 Cavalry, was bestowed with the prestigious Maha Vir Chakra. This accolade
celebrated his unwavering determination and instrumental role in the success of the Battle of Asal

JC-18340,(At the time of Award) Subedar,Ajit Singh,4 SIKH,"Subedar Ajit Singh was born on 08 April 1933 to Shri Ujagar Singh in Sobhana village in the
Jalandhar District of Punjab. He joined the Army at the age of 19 years and was enrolled into the
Sikh Regiment on 23 May 1952. During the Indo-Pak war in 1965, Subedar Ajit Singh’s unit, 4
Sikh, was deployed in Punjab Sector, South of Amritsar.
The Sikh Regiment is one of the highest decorated regiments of the Indian Army. It came into
existence on 01 August 1846, with the raising of Regiment of Ferozepore Sikhs and Regiment
of Ludhiana Sikhs by Captain G Tebbs and Lieutenant Colonel P Gordon respectively. They
participated effectively in the 1857 First War of Independence. This war proved to be beneficial
for the Sikhs as it revealed their valour and fighting tenacity. They soon earned a rank of
seniority over other Indian Sepoys. Under the British Indian Army, the Sikh Regiment fought
gallantly in a number of war and battles including the Battle of Saragarhi in which they left an
indelible mark in the regiment’s history. By 1914 the Sikh Regiment was deployed as part of
British Indian Army for operations in World War I. The Regiment served in all theatres of
operations and earned 28 battle honours. The modern Sikh Regiment traces its roots directly
from the 11th Sikh Regiment of the British Indian Army. When transferred to the Indian Army
post-Independence, the numeral 11 was removed and new battalions were added. 1 SIKH was
later mechanised in 1970 and re-designated as 4 MECHANISED INFANTRY on 02 April 1979.
The genesis of the Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu
and Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our frontiers with
Pakistan have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing,
incursions and intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive
measures. These attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with
commendable bravery and steely resilience, but always with great restraint to not escalate the
conflict. The Indo-Pak war of 1965 was the second war fought between these two bordering
countries. While India was still recovering from the Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as
an opportunity to acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms
of defence preparation. The war began on 24 April 1965, when the Pakistan Army attacked
Indian territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory.
This act of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of the Indo-Pak Border
Agreement, 1960 and the international law as per the United Nations Charter. The Pakistani
forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation Gibraltar.
On the 06 September 1965, GOC 7 Infantry Division ordered Brig Ferris, Commander 65
Infantry Brigade, to resume advance at 0700 hours next morning, by which time the bailey
bridge over the Hudiara drain was expected to be ready. The GOC appreciated the Pakistani
strength in the area at two infantry battalions, supported by a squadron of armour and a regiment
of artillery, reduced of course by the casualties suffered at Hudiara. He allotted the following
additional troops to the Brigade:
a) Under Command – Central Indian Horse (Shermans) less one squadron; 94 Field
Company; and Tentacle with ACT.
b) In direct support – 165 Field Regiment
c) In support – 7 Artillery Brigade less 165 Field Regiment, one battery 66 Field Regiment
and 82 Light Regiment.
Brig Ferris had no time for reconnaissance. His appreciation was, therefore, based on a general
study of the area and perusal of maps, including the one captured from a Pakistani. Finally, he
decided to secure Barka Kalan. The causeway and the bailey bridge, 200 yards to the west of
Hudiara, became operational by 1545 hours on 07 September. Soon after, 9 MADRAS with BSquadron Central India Horse advanced to capture Barka Kalan and secured it by 1800 hours
despite heavy firing from the village. A half-hearted counter-attack launched by Pakistani troops
was beaten back.
North of the road, the 16 PUNJAB patrols were subjected to firing from the Barka Khurd village
on 08 September. 65 Infantry Brigade decided to capture it and the task was entrusted to 16
PUNJAB. The Battalion launched the attack at 2030 hours on 09 September and captured Barka
Khurd by 2100 hours, without suffering any casualty.
7 Infantry Division maintained relentless pressure on the Pakistani defenders and advanced
further to capture Barki on its way to the Ichhogil Canal. The task was entrusted to 65 Infantry
Brigade, which decided to complete it in 2 Phases.
Phase I: 4 SIKH to capture the Barki Village
Phase II: 16 PUNJAB to capture the east bank of Ichhogil and destroy the Barki Brigade.
Prior to launching of the attack by 4 SIKH, Indian guns engaged known Pakistani positions from
1930 hours to 1955 hours. From 1955 hours to 2000 hours, the positions at Barki and along the
East bank of the Canal were neutralised. At 2000 hours, the Division artillery, including 5 Field
Regiment, effectively engaged Barki Village and covered the advance of 4 SIKH. When the
assaulting troops neared the objective, Central India Horse less two Squadrons moved forward
to provide fire support to them. In the moonlit night, the Indian armour sprayed the canal bank
and the village with fire, effectively. The Indian advance was, however, held up by a well-sited
enemy gun position. Subedar Ajit Singh was assigned the task of destroying the gun
emplacement which was holding up the Indian attack. In complete disregard of his safety,
the Subedar Ajit Singh charged the emplacement single-handedly. Though wounded in the chest
by a burst of medium machine gun, he pressed home the attack and destroyed the post by
lobbing a grenade through a loophole in the emplacement. Sub Ajit Singh’s gallant act not only
removed the menace of the machine gun but also inspired his comrades to destroy the enemy
position. Subedar Ajit Singh later succumbed to his injuries and was martyred. 4 SIKH captured
Barki Village after overcoming all resistance by 2110 hours. The defenders, lodged in pill
boxes, were either killed or captured.
According to GOC, 7 Infantry Division, continuous firing by the Indian armour at night, led
Pakistanis to believe that the Indians had brought in new tanks with night vision, and hence they
abandoned Barki out of fear. It is said that the Pakistanis took away four truck-loads of corpses
from the battlefield of Barki. In this battle 4 SIKH suffered 3 JCOs and 20 ORs killed and 2
Officers, 1 JCO and 93 ORs wounded.A statue of Subedar Ajit Singh

During the assault on Barki, Subedar Ajit Singh of 4 SIKH displayed great courage. Though
wounded in the chest by a machine gun burst, he crawled forward and lobbed a grenade inside a
Pakistani bunker and destroyed it. He was honoured with the MahaVir Chakra, posthumously.","JC-18340 Subedar Ajit Singh, 4th Battalion, the Sikh Regiment (Posthumous)

On the 6th September, 1965, during the attack on Burki Village in Pakistan. Subedar Ajit Singh
was given the task of destroying a gun emplacement that was holding up the attack. In complete
disregard of his safety, he charged the emplacement single-handed and though wounded in the
chest by a burst of medium machine gun he pressed home the attack and destroyed the post by
lobbing a grenade through a loophole in the emplacement. This gallant act not only removed the
menace of the machine gun post but also inspired his comrade to destroy the enemy position.
Subedar Ajit Singh subsequently succumbed to his injuries.
In this action, Subedar Ajit Singh displayed supreme courage and devotion to duty of an

District of Uttar Pradesh. Major Asa Ram had two siblings, elder brother, Shri Pashuram Tyagi
and a younger brother Shri Shyam Sunder Tyagi. Major Asa Ram Tyagi was commissioned
into 3 JAT on 17 December 1961. In the Indo-Pak War of 1965, he was awarded the Maha Vir
Chakra for his conspicuous gallantry.
The JAT Regiment is one of the oldest Regiments of the Indian Army. It is an Infantry
Regiment that claims its origins to the Calcutta Native Militia raised in 1795, which later
became an Infantry Battalion of the Bengal Army. Jat people were historically considered to
be martial class and were enlisted in the British Army when the policy on class regiments came.
In 1922, during the grouping of the class Regiment the 9 Jat Regiment was formed by bringing
under a single Regiment, four active Battalions and one Training Battalion. In the post-
independent era, the JAT Regiment has lived up to their reputation and holds the distinction of
fighting in all the wars that India fought since its independence including the IPKF to Sri Lanka.
Their battle cry: Jat Balwan, Jai Bhagwan was adopted in 1955. 17 JAT received “Unit","” from the Chief of the Army Staff, General VP Malik for their conspicuous courage
in the Kargil War.

On 21 September 1965, 3 JAT as part of 15 Infantry Division was assigned the task to capture
enemy positions in Dograi village of Pakistan. A Company led by Major Asa Ram Tyagi passed
along the Eastern edge of Dograi, where D Company was still fighting, to the Southern edge
of the town. Major Tyagi after assessing the enemy deployment and available resources with
him decided to press ahead with the forward-most Platoon of his Company. The Company
silenced an MMG in a pill-box on the GT road, and then fighting across the road, forced a
soldier of the Pakistani 23 Cavalry and remnants of the 16 (Pak) Punjab to surrender.
Subsequently, it came under intense automatic fire from a Company of 8 (Pak) Punjab,
entrenched along a pill-box guarding the southern approach to Dograi. In a gallant charge thepill-box was destroyed and the defenders dislodged. In this action, Major Tyagi was mortally
wounded.
Major Tyagi courageously led the forward-most Platoon of his Company in the assault on the
Eastern edge of the Dograi township. The area, fortified with pillboxes, recoilless guns, and a
Troop of tanks, posed a formidable defense. Despite sustaining two bullet injuries, Major Tyagi
pressed forward, engaging Pakistani tanks, throwing grenades at their crews, and successfully
capturing the tanks intact. He also shot and bayonetted a Major. His unwavering leadership
continued until two more bullet hits made him unconscious. Motivated by their Commander,
the men rallied and successfully overran the enemy stronghold.
In the Battle of Dograi, numerous JAT soldiers showcased exceptional valor. Major Asa Ram
Tyagi was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra for exceptional courage, posthumously.
Four Aan Comics were also released on August 28, 2015 based on the heroics of four war
heroes who fought in 1965 Indo Pak war and were awarded Maha Vir Chakra. They were Maj

Jhunjhunu District of Rajasthan. His father’s name was Arjan Ram. Jemadar Sanwal Ram was
enrolled into 6 RAJ RIF on 31 August 1929 at the age of eighteen. He fought in the first Indo-Pak
war of 1948-48 and displayed considerable skill and gallantry in the defence of ‘Subash’ picquet
in Uri, Jammu & Kashmir. It was a vital post for the defence of Uri. He was awarded Vir Chakra
for his conspicuous bravery in the face of enemy.
Rajputana Rifles is the senior most Rifle Regiment of the Indian Army. Its first battalion was raised
in January 1775. The Rajputana Rifles has a long and glorious history. The Regiment took part in
some of the bloodiest battles in many theatres of the world. During World War II, the battalions
of this regiment fought in every theatre in which the Indian Army was involved. Three of them,
the 1st, 4th and medium machine gun battalions fought in Eritrea in North Africa and Italy as part
of the famous 4th Indian Division, whose fighting record was one of the finest in World War II.
Post-independence the regiment took part in many battles and operations including the UN
Peacekeeping Mission in Congo. The Rajputana Rifles fought gallantly in the 1965 and 1971 India
Pakistan wars as well as during the 1999 Kargil Conflict.
The first Indo-Pak war fought between the independent countries of India and Pakistan began in
1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan were the attempts by Pakistan to annex
the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. On the map of India, the state of Jammu
and Kashmir appeared as a somewhat rectangular projection in the extreme North-West corner of
the sub-continent. In size it was the largest of the Indian ‘Princely States’ during the pre-
independence era. It was 222,870sq km or roughly double the area of Demark, the Netherlands,
Belgium and Luxemburg combined. The state was important because of its strategic location. Even
before the birth of Pakistan, Jammu and Kashmir was surrounded on almost three sides by foreign
states. Today, its importance has been accentuated by recent international developments. To the
East lay Tibet; to its North lies Chinese Turkestan or Sinkiang (Xinjiang); to West is Afghanistan;
to South-West and South was Pakistan; and to the South and South-East lay the states of Punjab
and Himachal Pradesh of India.1 The narrow Wakhan corridor, a narrow strip of territory in
Afghanistan, extending to China and separating Tajikistan from Gilgit-Baltistan, was to the North
West.
During the war, when enemy pressure increased in Uri-Mahura Sector in April 1948, two
battalions 6 RAJ RIF and 2 DOGRA were manning the picquets in Uri. 6 RAJ RIF was garrisoned
at Chauhan, Subash, Ashoka, Man, Ranjit, Nalwa and a picquet a little to the East in Uri Sector.

‘Chauhan’ was about 900 metres South of the spur which ended abruptly in a steep cliff and
‘Ashoka’ was about 630 metres in the north separated by a forest of pine tree. It was in the middle
of the April, when with the advent of the spring, the enemy launched fierce assaults on the Indian
picquets, especially ‘Subash’, ‘Ashoka’ and ‘Nalwa’. On 18 April, enemy movements were
observed in the area of Kalagai and by the close of the day their activities indicated an attack during
the following night. At about 1815 hours on 18 April, the enemy launched an attack on first
‘Subash’ picquet and then ‘Ashoka’ picquet but were unable to dislodge Indian troops from the
two picquets. Both attacks were beaten back with heavy losses to the enemy. By 2300 hours,
having failed both attacks, the enemy launched an attack on the third picquet ‘Nalwa’. This picquet
was key to defences of Uri and was spoken of as ‘Uri Ka Morcha’. During this attack, the enemy
didn’t dare to come near the picquet for launching the attack and used long range arms. The attack
was again repelled by the Indian troops and enemy suffered heavy losses.2

was done. But an attack came around 1835 hours, when two platoons of the enemy emerged out
of the jungle and advanced up the spur to attack the picquet. The fire was intense and heavy. The
men garrisoning the picquet reserved their fire waiting for enemy to draw nearer. Jemadar Sanwal
Ram, who was commanding the garrison completely disregarded his personal. Safety and went
from post to post in pitch darkness encouraging his men and at the same time hurling grenades at
the enemy. They brought fire from their guns on to the enemy turning enemy’s war cries into
pitiable moans of wounded and the dying. The enemy, having failed to over-run the position in
three waves, made a final desperate attempt to rush in. At this moment, Jemadar Sanwal Ram went
forward under incessant enemy fire and killed five enemy soldiers with his sten gun and grenade.

Bakshi Lal Chand. He was born in Gulyana village, Rawalpindi District (Now, in Pakistan),
Punjab. After completing his graduation from Gordon College, Rawalpindi, he joined Indian
Military Academy (IMA) in 1942. He was commissioned on 27 June 1943 into the Infantry. He
had a unique distinction of being the most highly decorated officer of the Indian Army, having
won awards for gallantry at every level, from Company to Division. He was a rare combination
of a fighting and thinking soldier, he is as well known for his achievements as for his reluctance
to talk about them. A perfect blend of a soldier and a gentleman, 'Zoru' Bakshi -as he is
affectionately known throughout the Army is an icon who was a source of inspiration for an
entire generation of officers. Lieutenant General Zorawar Chand Bakshi took part in every war
fought by the independent India, except for the Sino-India war of 1962, when he was deployed in
Congo for the United Nations peacekeeping operation.
After a short attachment with a British battalion, Lieutenant General Zorawar Chand Bakshi was
posted to 16/10 Baluch, which was then in the Arakan in Burma, and part of 51 Infantry Brigade
under 25 Indian Division. The battalion was being commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John
Fairlay, who was very fond of Indian officers since he had been an instructor at the IMA
Dehradun. The Second -in-Command was Brigadier (then Major) Mohammad Usman. When
Bakshi joined the battalion, the monsoon had just finished and operations had resumed after a
long gap. Usman sent Bakshi with a patrol through the No Man's Land to probe the Japanese
defences. Since Bakshi had just joined the battalion and was in-experienced, the patrol was led
by a Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO), who had been told to keep an eye on the young
officer. While climbing up the hill the Japanese opened fire. They could either withdraw or
bypass the enemy. A withdrawal would have led them into enemy ambush. Displaying
extraordinary leadership skills and presence of mind, then Second Lieutenant Bakshi decided to
go downhill. They were able to bypass the enemy position safely after completing the task.
The JCO reported to Usman and told him about the firing, and how the young subaltern had
handled the patrol. On the following day, Usman sent another patrol to check out a hill feature
held by the Japanese, and asked Bakshi to lead it. Zoru took some men from his own Company,
which comprised Pathans, and returned with some useful information about the feature. The CO,
Lieutenant Colonel Fairlay, was leaving on transfer next day, but before he left, he gave orders
for the hill to be captured, and assigned the Dogra Company to carry out the task. Fairlay had
begun his career in the Dogras, and had a soft corner for them. However, he did not have much
faith in the British officer who was commanding the Dogra Company, and ordered Bakshi to
lead the attack. 1

Publications, New DelhiIn January 1945, 51 Infantry Brigade took part in the Battle of Kangaw, which was one of the
hardest fought battles of the Burma Campaign. The Brigade Commander, Brigadier RA Hutton,
was awarded the DSO, as were all three Commanding Officers of the famous 'All Indian
Brigade', i.e., Lieutenant Colonels SPP Thorat, KS Thimayya and LP Sen. Zoru Bakshi was
Mentioned in Dispatches, and this was the first in a string of gallantry awards that he was to win
in different wars over the next 30 years. After cessation of operations in Burma, the battalion was
sent back to India for rest and refit, and was located at Pollachi near Madras. But it did not stay
in India for long, and was soon moved to Malaysia with the rest of the Division. However, the
Japanese surrendered soon after they landed, and the battalion was given the task of looking after
prisoners of war. It remained in Malaysia for about a year before being repatriated to India.
When the 1947-48 Indo-Pak war boke-out in August 1947, Lieutenant General Zorawar Chand
Bakshi was posted to the Punjab Boundary Force, which had been set up to maintain peace in
Punjab, under Major General TW Rees, who was commanding 4 Indian Division. As a member
of the Boundary Force, Bakshi witnessed the horrors of Partition at close quarters. The exodus of
people from both sides was accompanied by violence that quickly escalated from individual acts
of looting and revenge to full-scale attacks by armed gangs.
The first Indo-Pak war fought between the independent countries of India and Pakistan began in
1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan were the attempts by Pakistan to annex
the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. On the map of India, the state of
Jammu and Kashmir appeared as a somewhat rectangular projection in the extreme North-West
corner of the sub-continent. In size it was the largest of the Indian ‘Princely States’ during the
pre-independence era. It was 222,870 sq km or roughly double the area of Demark, the
Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg combined. The state was important because of its strategic
location. Even before the birth of Pakistan, Jammu and Kashmir was surrounded on almost three
sides by foreign states. Today, its importance has been accentuated by recent international
developments. To the East lay Tibet; to its North lies Chinese Turkestan or Sinkiang (Xinjiang);
to West is Afghanistan; to South-West and South was Pakistan; and to the South and South-East
lay the states of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh of India. The narrow Wakhan corridor, a narrow
strip of territory in Afghanistan, extending to China and separating Tajikistan from Gilgit-
Baltistan, was to the North West. Some of the significant battles that took place in Jammu and
Kashmir were, the Battle of Badgam, capture and recapture of Jhangar, battle of Naushera, the
advance to Tithwal, the relief in Punch and the fight of Chhamb to Tithwal.It was soon apparent that the Boundary Force would not be able to maintain peace with the
meagre resources at its disposal. Civil administration had virtually ceased to exist, and the force
had to look after not only law and order, but also the arrangements for transportation, shelter and
food for the refugees, whose numbers had swelled to over 2 million. The supreme commander
was informed about the critical situation on the borders and the responsibility for maintaining
peace in their areas should be taken over by the respective governments. This was approved by
the Joint Defence Council and, on 01 September 1947, the Punjab Boundary force ceased to
exist. Ten battalions of the force, which belonged to regiments that had been allotted to Pakistan,
left to join their new formation. The remainder comprising units which were to stay in India,
were formed into the East Punjab. General Rees was appointed Military Assistant to Governor
General Lord Mountbatten and moved to Delhi, taking Bakshi along with him. In his new
assignment, Bakshi had to man operations room in the Governor General's House (now
Rashtrapati Bhawan).
Post-partition, Lieutenant General Zorawar Chand Bakshi’s parent unit 16/10 Baluch was
allotted to Pakistan. Bakshi was transferred to 5 GORKHA RIFLES which was one the six
Gorkha regiments to stay in India while rest were transferred to British Army. In March 1948,
Bakshi was posted as Brigade Major of 163 Infantry Brigade. 163 Infantry Brigade was given the
task of advancing towards Tithwal, clearing enemy opposition en route and recapturing lost
territory, including the strategic town of Tithwal. The brigade com. prised four infantry
battalions, ie., 1 SIKH, 1 MADRAS, 6 RAJPUTANA RIFLES and 3 GARHWAL, during
various stages of the battle. It also had a Squadron of 7 CAVALRY equipped with armoured
cars, and two hatteries of artillery guns. The brigade commenced operations from Handwara on
18 May 1948, and by 20 May had taken Chowkibal. The next day, the 10,000-foot high
Nastachun Pass had been cap-tured, and by 23 May Tithwal was in Indian hands. In five days,
163 Infantry Brigade had advanced 65 kilometres, killed 67 of the enemy and taken many
prisoners.
The loss of Tithwal was also a severe blow to the Pakistanis, who reacted violently and launched
several counter-attacks to recapture the feature. These attacks were supported by heavy shelling
and resulted in many casualties. There were also several individual acts of bravery, including that
of Company Havildar Major Piru Singh of 6 RAJPUTANA RIFLES, who was posthumously
awarded the Param Vir Chakra, the country's highest award for gallantry. Bakshi played. a
prominent part in the battle, and displayed exceptional gallantry and leadership, for which he was
awarded the Vir Chakra. This was remarkable, because Bakshi was the Principal Staff Officer in
the Brigade HQ, and was not commanding troops. Unlike commanders, staff officers rarely get achance to display gallantry on the battlefield. For his exemplary leadership and gallantry, he was
awarded Vir Chakra.
Shortly afterwards, Bakshi notched up another feat. The task allotted to Lieutenant General
Zorawar Chand Bakshi was to carry out an important strategic military reconnaissance of certain
areas in Tibet. He covered a distance of 400 kilometres in 80 days, and traversed some of the
highest passes in the Himalayas dressed as a Buddhist Monk. For this feat, he was awarded the
MacGregor Memorial Medal in 1949. He became the first recipient of the medal after
Independence. This medal was instituted in 1888 in memory of Major General Sir
Charles Metcalfe MacGregor, the founder of the United Service Institution of India. After
completing his tenure in 163 Infantry Brigade, Bakshi was posted back to the Regimental Centre
at Dehradun in July 1949.
Early in 1951, he was posted to 2/5 GORKHA RIFLES, which had moved to Dehradun recently,
after short tenures in Meerut and Jhansi. The battalion was under the command of Lieutenant
Colonel Niranjan Prasad. While he was with the Battalion, Bakshi appeared for the entrance
examination for Staff College, and after qualifying, was nominated to the Fourth Course at the
Defence Services Staff College, Wellington, which commenced in October 1951. After
completing the course in August 1952, he was posted as Brigade Major of 123 Infantry Brigade.
He remained in this appointment till October 1955. After his tenure with 123 Infantry Brigade,
Bakshi was posted to 2/5 GORKHA RIFLES, which was then located at Mahura in the Uri
sector of Jammu and Kashmir. In April 1958, he was posted as an Instructor to the Infantry
School, Mhow, where he remained for almost two years. In January 1960, he was promoted
Lieutenant Colonel and posted to the Staff College in Wellington as an Instructor.
In August 1961, he received orders posting him as Commanding Officer of 2/5 GORKHA
RIFLES, which was then in Calcutta and they were sent to Congo for United Nations
Peacekeeping mission. They started their journey in January 1962 and by 25 March, the
Battalion had concentrated in Elizabethville as part of the Indian Brigade, which was in the
Katanga province. The Indians formed part of the 27-nation United Nations Force called the
Organisation des Nations Unies au Congo (ONUC), which had its Headquarters at Leopoldville.
The task of the United Nations' peace-keeping force was to maintain law and order, and protect
vital installations from sabotage. The Battalion frequently had to fight the Katangese
Gendarmerie, and there were several skirmishes as well as some hard-fought battles resulting in
heavy casualties to both sides. By the end of the year, 2/5 GORKHA RIFLES had cleared
Elizabethville and the surrounding area within a radius of about 20 kilometres of all enemy
positions and minefields. After a year the battalion returned to India in March 1963 on-board thesame ship on which it had sailed to Congo. was awarded two Sena Medals and four 'Mentioned
in Dispatches’. For his contribution in ONUC, he was awarded Vashisht Seva Medal.
In August 1963, Bakshi was posted to the Military Operations Directorate in Delhi. From
December 1964 onwards, he officiated as the Director of Military Operations. Early in 1965,
Pakistan had launched operations in the Rann of Kutch to regain control of territory which
Pakistan claimed to be its own.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu
and Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our frontiers with
Pakistan have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing,
incursions and intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive
measures. These attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with
commendable bravery and steely resilience, but always with great restrain to not escalate the
conflict. The Indo-Pak war of 1965 was the second war fought between these two bordering
countries. While India was still recovering from the damages of Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan
saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak
in terms of defence preparation. The war initiated on 24 April 1965, when Pakistan Army,
attacked our territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian
territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak
Border Agreement 1960 and international law as per the United Nations Charter. The aerial
phase of the war began on 01 September 1965 when the Indian Air Force responded to an urgent
call for air strikes against the Pakistani Army.
In July 1965, Bakshi was promoted Brigadier and given command of the newly raised 68
Infantry Brigade, in Jammu and Kashmir. Though the brigade formed part of 3 Infantry Division
in Ladakh, it was located in the Kashmir valley. Pakistani infiltration began a few days after he
assumed command. Crossing the border at several places, the guerrillas began to blow up
bridges, establish roadblocks, and destroy administrative installations. Though the Indian troops
had no inkling of the planned infiltration, they were well prepared and their reaction was swift.
The infiltrators were dealt with wherever they were encountered, and soon most were either
liquidated or made to surrender. In some places, the Pakistanis used artillery to support the
guerrillas, thus escalating the operations. To prevent further ingress by guerrillas and to block the
routes that were being used by them, it was decided to capture some key tactical features. One of
these was the Hajipir pass.The road connecting Uri and Punch passed through the Hajipir pass at a height of 8,650 feet. The
pass was strategically very import-ant, and provided one of the main routes of ingress into the
Kashmir valley. In order to capture the pass, a pincer attack from two directions was planned,
with one Brigade ex-19 Infantry Division launching an attack from the north along the road from
Uri, and another Brigade ex-25 Infantry Division from the South, along the road coming from
Punch. The task of capturing the feature from the north was assigned to 68 Infantry Brigade. As
an indication of the confidence the higher command of the Army placed in then Brigadier
Zorawar Chand Bakshi, the operation for the capture of Hajipir was code-named Operation
Bakshi. Zoru Bakshi more than justified the faith reposed in him by his superiors. In one of the
most brilliant and successful operations of the 1965 War, they captured the Hajipir Pass when
then Major (later Lieutenant General) Ranjit Singh Dayal of 1 PARA in a daring operation
defying all odds surprised the enemy and seized this vital pass.
Lieutenant General Bakshi had only one battalion, 6 DOGRA, which had been raised just six
months earlier. For the operation, almost all the troops allotted to him were new to him. He
concentrated his brigade at Ur in the third week of August 1965, where most of his units joined
him. He had three infantry battalions: 1 PARA, 19 PUNJAB and 4 RAJPUT. Another battalion
ex-161 Infantry Brigade was placed under his command for the operation. He also had an
artillery regiment, 164 FIELD REGIMENT, equipped with 25-pounder field guns, 144
MOUNTAIN BATTERY, and a troop of medium guns ex-39 Medium Regiment. In addition, he
had the usual complement of Engineers and Signals. The artillery ammunition was restricted-the
field guns had five first line scales, and the medium guns four first lines. Information about the
exact dispositions of the enemy was scanty. Bakshi was not permitted to carry out any ground
reconnaissance or visit the area held by troops of 161 Infantry Brigade, through which he had to
pass to launch the attack. The Hajipir pass and the subsidiary features covering its approaches,
were known to be held by 20 PUNJAB of the Pak Army. To distract the enemy's attention and
prevent them from reinforcing their position, troops deployed all along the Cease Fire Line in the
19 Infantry Division sector were ordered to put in small-scale attacks to coincide with the main
attack of 68 Infantry Brigade. Strange as it may seem, Bakshi was not told about the pincer
movement, or the attack by 93 Infantry Brigade from the South. Bakshi's plan for the operation
envisaged a two-pronged attack from the north, to be conducted in three phases. After multiple
failed attempts, on 27 August 1965, Major Ranjit Singh Dayal left with his column at last light
to hit the enemy with an attack went on the night of 28/29 August. He was accompanied by
Captain Vaswani as his Second-in-Command, and Second-Lieutenant JS Talwar of 164 Field
Regiment as the FOO.
At about 0430 Hours on 28 August, when the Company hit the old Uri-Punch road, Dayal
decided to give the men a much-needed break. After a few hours of rest, the advance wasresumed at 0700 hrs When they had advanced for about an hour, the leading Platoon negotiated a
turn and came under intense machine-gun fire from the western shoulder of the pass. The area
was open, and the objective was almost 1,200 yards away. Leaving the leading platoon and the
forward observation officer to keep the enemy engaged from the front, Dayal took the balance of
the Company to the right and began climbing up the western shoulder of the pass. On reaching
the top, they rolled down, completely surprising the Pakistani soldiers, who took to their heels
without offering any resistance. By 1100 hours on 28 August, Hajipir pass had been captured.
Twelve Pakistanis, including one officer, were taken prisoner. There was not a single Indian
casualty.
This operation was among one of the most complex operations to be executed during 1965 Indo-
Pak war. The road connecting Uri and Poonch via Haji Pir had deteriorated due to disuse and
some places it had disintegrated. There was no direct route for an approach to Haji Pir except
over the mountain ranges. Haji Pir at an altitude of 9,000 feet had strong enemy defensive
positions forward of it and flanking it.
Throughout, Brigadier Bakshi remained foremost. As soon as an objective was captured, he was
there personally to guide and help in the reorganisation. Many a time, though enemy shelling
was intense and continuous, he remained in the forefront without regard for his personal safety.
After the capture of Haji Pir, 01 September he moved his tactical headquarters to Haji Pir Pass
immediately. The battle of Hajipir pass is a saga of courage, determined leadership and valour.
Its capture was an important victory for India, and a big blow for Pakistan. The credit for the
success went to Dayal, who had led his men resolutely, and to Bakshi, who had not only
conceived the bold plan, fraught with risk, but had executed it brilliantly. For his grit and
determination, he was awarded Maha Vir Chakra (MVC), the country's second highest gallantry
had having already won the Vir Chakra earlier, he became the only Indian to have won both theawards. Major Ranjit Singh Dayal was also awarded the MVC for his courage and gallantry in
capturing the Hajipir pass.
In March 1967, Bakshi was posted as Brigadier General Staff, HQ Eastern Command, in
Calcutta. Lieutenant General Sam Manekshaw was the Army Commander, and he found Bakshi
to be a pragmatic, efficient and competent Staff Officer. At that time, Eastern Command was
engaged in building up defences in the North-East, which had become the Indian Army's top
priority after the debacle of 1962.
In December 1967, he was selected to do the course at the Imperial Defence College, London.
This was a prestigious course, on which only highly rated officers of the rank of Brigadier were
sent. He stayed in London for a year and qualified on the course with distinction. On his return
from England in February 1969, Bakshi was posted to the Military Training Directorate at Army
Headquarters. In June 1969, he was promoted to Major General and appointed GOC 8 Mountain
Division in Nagaland, where insurgency had become a serious problem.
In September 1970, Bakshi was posted as GOC 26 Infantry Dirision, which was responsible for
the defence of Jammu in 1971. The operations commenced on 03 December 1971 after air-
strikes by Pakistan, and orders were issued for the planned advances by Indian troops to
commence. However, due to the Pakistani offensive in Chhamb, 10 Infantry Division had to fall
back and could not undertake any offensive action. A Brigade of 26 Infantry Division was sent to
39 Infantry Division to make up the loss of 33 Infantry Brigade, which had been dispatched to
Punch to counter the Pakistani offensive in that Sector. This resulted in the cancellation of the
all-important offensive of 26 Infantry Division towards Sialkot.
However, Bakshi was not deterred by this setback and proceeded to capture Chicken's Neck, an
important gain of the 1971 operations, which compensated to some extent the loss of Chhamb by
10 Infantry Division. The name 'Chicken's Neck' was coined by Lieutenant Genral Bakshi. To
the South of Akhnur, there is a narrow strip of territory that belongs to Pakistan and measures
about 170 square kilometres in area. It is actually an islet between the river Chenal and Chander
Bagha, one of its subsidiary channels. It has a small neck in the south, and a jagged head, with a
beak shaped like a dagger extending towards the north. The beak points towards the Akhnur
bridge, and because his shape and the threat it posed to Akhnur, the area had long been known as
‘the dagger' Bakshi felt that the name indicated defensive mentality and promptly informed
every one that henceforth it would be called the 'Chicken's Neck', which could be wrung at will
by India. It is known by this name even today .In order to remove the Pakistani threat to the Akhnur bridge, he decided to capture Chicken's
Neck. Bakshi decided to infiltrate the South, from where the enemy least expected an attack. On
05 December 1971, the operation achieved complete surprise, and the leading Battalion found
well-prepared defences, which were not occupied as they had been vacated by the Pakistanis. In
spite of this, the leading troops made slow progress, since they insisted on following set piece
battle drills, losing precious time. The situation called for bold and audacious action, but the
commanders were overcautious and refused to exploit the factors of surprise and de-moralised
enemy.
Bakshi arranged to set up roadblocks, using his tanks and the para commandos. However, most
of the enemy was able to withdraw before the roadblocks were in place. In one case, some
armour that had been inducted into the salient to hasten its clearance, clashed with the roadblock
armour, which mistook them for withdrawing Pakistani tanks. Timely intervention by the
Brigade HQ staff averted what could have been a disaster. The para commando roadblock at one
of the ferries was attacked by a large body of withdrawing Pakistani troops, and had to be
rescued by tank-mounted infantry which was rushed to their aid. By the evening of 07
December, the Chicken's Neck was captured. After the capture of Chicken's Neck, 26 Infantry
Division had little to do and had to content itself with small raids on border outports opposite its
area. It was unfortunate that higher commanders bond no use for the gallant commander or the
troops of 26 Infantry Division, which had been relieved after the operation, for the rest of the
war. Since Bakshi had already won both the MVC and the VrC earlier, he was awarded the
Param Vashisht Seva Medal (PVSM) for this operation.
After completing his tenure in 26 Infantry Division, in October 1973, Zoru was appointed the
Director of Military Operations (DMO), at Army Headquarters. He remained for a year in this
important appointment, which carries a lot of respect and authority: in September 1974, he was
promoted Lieutenant General and was appointed as the Military Secretary, at Army
Headquarters.
In May 1975, Bakshi was given command of the 2 Corps, the Strike Corps, which is perhaps one
of the most coveted assignments for a Lieutenant General. He replaced Lieutenant General TN
Raina, who moved on promotion as Western Army Commander, and later became the Army
Chief. Bakshi remained in command of 2 Corps for more than three-and-a-half years, till he
retired on 31 January 1979. He thus had the longest tenure as a Corps Commander in the Indian
Army.
After retirement, Bakshi settled down in Defence Colony in New Delhi and did not take up a job
in either the private or public sector. With his drive and determination, he was ideally suited for a
challenging assignment, such as breathing new life into a sick public sector undertaking. Butbecause of his modest and unassuming nature, he was not very well known outside the Army,
and perhaps this is why his services were not in demand. However, he continued to take keen
interest in the profession of arms, and was a regular visitor to the United Service Institution of
India in Delhi.
Lieutenant General Zorawar Chand Bakshi is one of highly decorated officers of the Indian
Army breathed his last breath on 24 May 2018. He would always be remembered as true son of
the soil, who defended the honour of his motherland and of his command, always and every
time. Highly respected for his professionalism and personal qualities he left behind a rich legacy
and set standards for others to emulate.
Remembering the legend Zoru Bakshi-
Former Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh said he last met Gen Bakshi after the
capture of Haji Pir Pass. “He was the Commander of 68 Brigade and I was ADC to Army
Commander General Harbaksh. A great soldier. His death is a great loss to the country. RIP Sir!”
tweeted the CM.
“Despite all his achievements, he remained a humble, down-to-earth man. Never bragging or
gloating over the wars he had fought or his decorations,” says Lieutenant General Narayan
Pathania, who served with him from 1970 till Gen Bakshi retired in 1979.
“He belonged to the 5th Gorkhas, who wear the chin strap of the Gorkha hat not under the chin
but under the lower lip. He believed that it signalled doing your job and not talking about it, and
followed that in principle,” adds General Pathania. “Apart from being a brave soldier and a
remarkable leader of men, he was an ideal and an inspiration,” says General Pathania.
His son Rajeev says his father was a “great human being who equipped us with the ability to
discern but gave us the freedom to make our choices in life, to be audacious to take a road less
travelled and to treat life as a great adventure.” “No idea or belief was too sacrosanct to be left
unquestioned except honesty and integrity. These values were passed on to his grandchildren as
was his love for the outdoors, the hills and nature,” Rajeev adds.","Major Zorawar Chand Bakshi (SS-1510), 2/5 GORKHA RIFLES
(Effective date of award – 05 August 1965)
Brigadier Zorawar Chand Bakshi was commander of a brigade in Aug-Sept 1965 employed on
the difficult task of capturing Basali, Haji Pir Pass and Kahuta, which was vital for the Uri-
Poonch link-up. The road connecting Uri and Poonch via Haji Pir had deteriorated due to disuse
and some places it had disintegrated. There was no direct route for an approach to Haji Pir except
over the mountain ranges. Haji Pir at an altitude of 9,000 feet had strong enemy defensive
positions forward of it and flanking it.
Throughout, Brigadier Bakshi remained foremost. As soon as an objective was captured, he was
there personally to guide and help in the reorganisation. Many a time, though enemy shelling
was intense and continuous, he remained in the forefront without regard for his personal safety.
After the capture of Haji Pir, he moved forward his tactical headquarters immediately, though he
knew that the enemy would most certainly counter-attack it viciously.
Throughout this operation, Brigadier Bakshi displayed a high standard of planning and tactical
skill, combined with outstanding leadership, determination and camaraderie in sharing the
hardships of his troops, which were in the highest traditions of our Army.

Jaipur, Rajasthan. He was commissioned into the Sawai Man Guards as a Second Lieutenant
on 18 April 1943. He is survived by his two sons— Maj Sangram Singh & Narendra Singh
Rajawat. He participated in the Burma War in 1944 and went to Japan to fight. Thereafter, he
fought in the Indo-Pak War of 1947-48 in the Uri Sector immediately after independence.
During the Korean war in 1954, he was posted as Chairman of the Neutral Nations
Representative Commission (NNRC) as part of the Peacekeeping Force. During the 1958-59
Israel-Egypt War, he was part of the United Nations Emergency Force. In the Indo-Pak War of
1965, Lieutenant Colonel Raghubir Singh was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra on 07 September
1965 while commanding his Battalion 18 RAJPUTANA RIFLES which is now 11
MECHANISED INFANTRY.
The RAJPUTANA RIFLES is the senior most Rifle Regiment of the Indian Army. Its first
Battalion was raised in January 1775. The RAJPUTANA RIFLES has a long and glorious
history. The Regiment took part in some of the bloodiest battles in many theatres of the world.
During World War II, the Battalions of this Regiment fought in every theatre in which the
Indian Army was involved. Three of them, the 1st, 4th and Medium Machine Gun Battalions
fought in Eritrea in North Africa and Italy as part of the famous 4th Indian Division, whose
fighting record was one of the finest in World War II. Post-Independence the Regiment took
part in many battles and operations including the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Congo. The
Rajputana Rifles fought gallantly in the 1965 and 1971 India Pakistan wars. During the 1965
Indo-Pak war, the RAJPUTANA RIFLES displayed exemplary valour and determination
especially in the Khem Karan Sector. During the 1999 Kargil War 2 RAJPUTANA RIFLES
was instrumental in capturing Tololing.

the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of
the Indo-Pak Border Agreement ,1960 and the international law as per the United Nations
Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation
Gibraltar. The 1965 War was fought in various Sectors including in Khem Karan which was
the area of responsibility of 4 Infantry Division and 2 (Independent) Armoured Brigade.Historians consider this to be the greatest tank battle since the Battle of Kursk, fought during
World War II– The Battle of Asal Uttar, a pivotal engagement in the 1965 India-Pakistan War,
unfolded from 08 September to 10 September 1965. Positioned near Khem Karan, the Indian
resistance played a crucial role in shifting the balance of power in India’s favour during the
conflict. The Pakistani Army’s Battle Group, composed of the 1st Armoured Division and 11
Infantry Division, had crossed the International Border, and captured the Indian town of Khem
Karan.
Recognizing the seriousness of the situation, the Major General Gurbaksh Singh, General
Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 4 Mountain Division ordered the Division to withdraw and
establish “Horse Shoe” shaped defensive position centred on Asal Uttar. Three Indian Army
units, namely the 18 RAJPUTANA RIFLES, 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES, and 4 GRENADIERS,
were strategically positioned to cover three axes leading to Khem Karan, providing depth to
the location. 9 JAK RIFLES were deployed in the rear, while the DECCAN HORSE
commanded by Lieutenant Colonel (later General) AS Vaidya, was positioned ahead, to the
South East of the Division’s defences. In a well-executed tactical manoeuvre, Indian troops
breached the Rohi canal at night, flooding the sugarcane fields. When morning came, the M-7
and M-48 Patton tanks of the 1st Armoured Division of Pakistan were lured into the horse-shoe
shaped defensive position with the intention of overwhelming Indian defences. However, the
swampy terrain slowed down the advance of the Pakistani tanks, which ultimately became
immobilized in the muddy slush.
With the Pakistani M-47 and M-48 Patton tanks approaching within 900 meters of the main
defences, the Deccan Horse, equipped with Shermans, engaged them effectively and destroyed
eleven Pakistani tanks.Brigadier Raghubir Singh shaking hands with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi

On the night of 09 September 1965 at 0200 hours, the Pakistani Pattons being equipped with
infra-red devices had an edge over our Indian tanks which were comparatively blind at night.
The 4 Armoured Brigade of Pakistan, utilizing moonlight and infra-red equipment, launched
an attack on the 18 RAJPUTANA RIFLES position, with two Patton Regiments. Despite
achieving a breakthrough, the Pattons couldn't breach the Indian defences and withdrew after
sustaining casualties. At 0430 hours on the same day, the 2 (Independent) Armoured Brigade
came under the command of the 4 Mountain Division. The deployment of troops in the 4
Mountain Division Sector included battalions in the Asal Uttar area, a Squadron of DECCAN
HORSE between the Brigade-defended Sector and the gun area, 3 Cavalry sub units in various
locations, and 8 Cavalry deployed in the Warnala area. Despite an unsuccessful attempt to
overrun the 4 GRENADIERS position, the Pakistanis made another effort to attack the 18
RAJPUTANA RIFLES position during the night. However, the Battalion held its ground, and
Indian medium artillery and tanks, strategically positioned, inflicted significant damage on the
attackers. Soon after, the assault fizzled out and the enemy who had expected an easy
breakthrough, withdrew in frustration.
Lieutenant Colonel Raghuvir Singh, the Commanding Officer of the Battalion, displayed
exceptional bravery and leadership in this encounter, earning him the Mahavir Chakra for his
outstanding actions.Brigadier Raghubur Singh receiving the Maha Vir Chakra medal from President

Lieutenant Colonel Raghubir Singh was commanding a battalion of the Rajputana Rifles
Regiment during the battle of Asal Uttar. The unit was occupying the left forward position of
a Brigade defended sector. During the period from the 7th to the 10th September 1965, the unit
was attacked twice by day and twice at night by Pakistani forces in overwhelming strength,
supported by armour and intense artillery fire.
On 9th September at 2100 hours, in moonlight, the enemy forces launched a ferocious
attack with tanks and managed to overrun the forward Company positions. The situation
became grave and communications with these Companies were disrupted. Lieutenant Colonel
Raghubir Singh, anticipating the enemy’s tank assault left his Command post and regardless
of personal safety moved up to those Companies past three enemy tanks. He entered the
positions under intense enemy artillery fire and established contact with the Company
Commanders. This example of courage, determination and leadership on the part of the
Commanding Officer inspired the men to defy the enemy tanks and under his command they
destroyed twenty enemy tanks.Reference: Gazette of India, Notification No. 9 - Pres./ 66 dated January 01, 1966",

Mubayi. Captain Mubayi was commissioned into the 2 DOGRA — a Regiment known for its
valiant soldiers and numerous battle honours — of the Indian Army on 23 September 1963, at
the age of twenty years. During Indo-Pak War of 1965, Captain Mubayi’s unit was deployed
in J&K in the Mendhar Sector.
The DOGRA Regiment, raised in 1877 is one of the older infantry regiments of the Indian
Army. The Regiment traces its roots directly from the 17th Dogra Regiment of the British
Indian Army. After World War I, the British Indian government restructured the army,
moving from Regiments with a single Battalion to multi–Battalion Regiments. In 1945, it
shed the numeral ‘17’ and became Dogra Regiment. The DOGRA Regiment has troops from
Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, and the Northern districts of Punjab. Their
Regimental war cry is “Jwala Mata Ki Jai” (Victory to Goddess Jwala). The Dogras have
participated in all the wars and conflicts fought by the Indian Army since independence and
winning laurels. General NC Vij, PVSM, UYSM, AVSM who was the 21st Chief of the
Army also belonged to the DOGRA Regiment.

Border Agreement, 1960 and the international law as per the United Nations Charter. The
Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation Gibraltar.
Chuni Nar feature, called OP Hill by the Indians, was a 1524-meter-high hill complex to the
South-West of the road Mendhar-Balnoi. It provided a dominating view of Indian defences
and road Mendhar-Balnoi. Pakistanis had occupied it sometime in early August and had
strengthened it into a Battalion-Defended position. A Pakistani Observation Post located at
the feature, directed artillery fire on the 2 DOGRA Picquet 636 twice in August.They also
launched attacks on the picquet but were beaten back.
On 18 September 1965, in a bid to isolate and ""strangle"" Picquet 636, Pakistanis infiltrated
into the area. The intrusion was cleared by a Dogra Company on the night of 20/21 September
1965. Pakistan then concentrated on developing OP Hill into a stronghold, with shell-proof
bunkers and wire obstacles, along three Spurs emanating from the Chuni-Nar. Explosives
were used to improve the defence works. They also continued the shelling of 2 DOGRA base
at Balnoi and Picquet 636. In the face of this shelling, the movement of Indian vehicle
convoys and troops on road Mendhar-Balnoi became impossible.
To dislodge Pakistanis from OP Hill, 2 GARHWAL RIFLES mounted an attack on the night
of 06/07 October 1965. But protected by strongly built defences they counter-attacked in
overwhelming strength and repulsed the attack with heavy losses."" In fact, nothing short of a
Brigade attack was needed to evict the enemy from OP Hill. An appeal to UN Observers also
failed to get the area vacated.
On 15 October 1965 a decision was taken to mount an attack on the feature in Brigade
strength. The task was entrusted to 120 Infantry Brigade.
According to the plan of operation, the attack was to be mounted in three Phases. In Phase
one, 2 DOGRA was to capture Twin Pimples and Black Rocks, and 5 SIKH LI the White
Rocks on D Day. In Phase two, 7 SIKH was to capture Jungle and OP Hill by 0500 his and in
Phase three, Twin Trees and Lone Tree by 0600 on D plus 1.2 DOGRA planned to launch the attack with two Companies. D Company was to capture
Black Rocks, whereas C Company with a Platoon of A Company was to capture Twin
Pimples. B Company was to serve as a reserve for D Company, while A Company less a
Platoon was to stand as reserve for C Company.
The Assaulting (C and D) Companies crossed the Cease-fire Line at 2200 hours on 02
November 1965 and formed up for the final assault below their respective objectives at 2245
hours, despite heavy artillery and automatic fire. C Company and the Platoon of A Company
suffered 50 per cent casualties in the shelling, yet they pushed on through the minefield and
wire obstacles and captured Twin Pimples and a feature to the South-West of it by 2345
hours, after a hand-to-hand fight. C Company was now left with only twenty survivors to hold
Twin Pimples, all others were either killed or wounded. The Pakistani soldiers fled, leaving
behind eleven dead and a large quantity of arms, ammunition, and equipment.
D Company also suffered heavy casualties in shelling and automatic fire, but it managed to
reach within 45 meters of the objective. Here, again it encountered extensive minefield, wire
obstacles and devastating automatic fire. Consequently, four assaulting Sections of the two
leading Platoons were practically written off. But the others pushed through the minefield on
a narrow frontage, created a breach through the wire obstacles and established a foothold. In a
two-hour long battle, the Company was badly mauled. At this juncture B Company was
rushed to reinforce D Company, but by then the enemy opposition had also stiffened and in
the heavy firing one third of B Company became casualties. Black Rock was finally captured
by the troops at 0430 hours on 03 November 1965.
During the battle of OP Hill, when the 2 DOGRA attack was held up by intense fire and
mounting casualties, Captain Gautam Mubayi led his Platoon through a minefield and
successfully established a Bridge-Head. Though injured by a mine blast he kept on moving
and neutralised an enemy MMG with grenade attack. He was mortally wounded by a
browning machine gun burst at a bridge-head. He was awarded the Mahavir Chakra for his
indomitable courage.
2 DOGRA, 5 SIKH LI and 7 SIKH after a grim battle lasting over two days, evicted the
intruders out of this formidable feature by a brilliantly conceived plan, executed with courage
and determination. Even after suffering very heavy casualties, the troops did not waiver. The
battle epitomised the courage of the troops and leadership of the officers.Captain Gautam Mubayi

The Dogra Regiment (Posthumous)
(Effective date of award– 2nd November 1965)
On the night of 2nd/3rd November 1965, a Company of a Dogra Regiment in which Captain
Gautam Mubayi was commanding a platoon was ordered to take possession of a feature in
Mendhar Sector. Jammu and Kashmir, which not-withstanding the ceasefire had been
encroached upon by Pakistani forces, and formed a part of a very strong enemy defence
complex. His objective consisted of a series of bunkers with a strong protective mine-field
and wire obstacle around it and covered by a well-coordinated automatic fire and supported
by mortar and artillery. When the assault launched by the Company was held up by intensive
enemy fire and heavy casualties due to the mine-fields. Captain Gautam Mubayi volunteered
to break through with his platoon to establish a bridge-hand. He crawled forward, cut the wire
himself and led his platoon forward through the minefields. He was wounded severely in the
leg by a mine but unmindful of his injury, he kept moving forward encouraging his men . By
this bold action, he established a bridge-head capturing a portion of his objective with only a
handful of his remaining men. An enemy light machine gun was firing from an enfilading
position, as a result of which his men suffered further casualties. He rushed forward and threw
a grenade to silence this bunker. He held on to his slender bridge-head in spite of heavy
enemy fire and grenade and refused to be evacuated or even to take cover. He moved
continuously from post to post exhorting his men to remain firm. This encouraged the
company to push forward towards its objective. While urging his men forward he was
mortally wounded by a burst from a Browning machine gun. Captain Gautam Mubayi showed
indomitable courage and inspiring leadership and made the supreme sacrifice in the best
traditions of the Indian Army.

Singh Samra, in Pakhoke Village of Tarn Taran District in Punjab. He did his schooling from
DAV School Shimla. After his graduation he got selected to join the Army as a short service
commissioned officer. He joined the No 08 SS course at Officers' Training Academy (OTA)
and passed out on 15 March 1970 at the age of 24 years. He got commissioned into 8
GUARDS of the Brigade of Guards, an Infantry Regiment with a glorious history of valour
and battle honours. Barely one and half years into service, Second Lieutenant Shamsher Singh
Samra got involved into thick of operations as his unit got deployed on the Eastern border,
when the war with Pakistan became imminent.
The Brigade of The Guards is a Regiment of the Indian Army. The troops from all parts of the
country serve in various battalions of this regiment. The regiment was formed in 1949 as the
first mixed class Indian regiment by Field Marshal KM Cariappa OBE. The GUARDS
Brigade was raised to implement the government’s policy of encouraging army recruitment
from regions under-represented in the forces. Three of Army’s oldest battalions - 2 PUNJAB,
1 GRENADIERS, and 1 RAJ RIF were converted as the GUARDS Battalions in 1949.
Though the Brigade of Guards is only 50 years old, its constituent battalions go back as far as
225 years. They also share 93 Battle Honours earned around the world. At the moment, the
Regiment consists of 19 Battalions. The majority of these operate as Mechanised Infantry.
During the first war of Kashmir 1 RAJPUT (4 GUARDS) showed their mettle in the battle of
Taindhar, where Naik Jadunath Singh fought valiantly and won the first Param Vir Chakra for
his regiment. During the 1971 Indo-Pak War, the Regiment earned its second Param Vir
Chakra through Lance Naik Albert Ekka of 14 GUARDS for heroism in Gangasagar in the
Eastern Theatre in 1971.
India gained Independence in 1947, and the partition resulted in the creation of Pakistan. The
foundation of Pakistan was laid by the Muslim League based on the two-nation theory.
Pakistan comprised two wings- East and West Pakistan which were geographically separated
by 1600 kms Indian Territory. The two wings of Pakistan were culturally and linguistically
different and the diversities between the two wings could not be bridged by an emotional
appeal to religion. Consequently, fissures started erupting in the political body of Pakistan
soon after the Independence and with each passing year it widened. In the absence of
appropriate defence arrangements, the people of East Pakistan felt isolated and abandoned.
Finally, the malfeasance of Pakistani leadership during Cyclone Bhola and the overwhelming
support for the Awami League in the 1970 elections, proved the proverbial last straw on the
camel’s back.2 The Awami League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (of East Pakistan) secured
an absolute majority in the general elections held in December 1970. This entitled the League
to form a Government in Pakistan. However, Pakistan’s military rulers denied this democratic
right to the Awami League, in connivance with the PPP, led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. This
arbitrary act of government caused deep resentment among the population of East Pakistan
resulting in widespread protests. When the slide became unmanageable, the Pakistani rulers
resorted to a midnight crackdown on 25 March 1971. The government ordered a military
crackdown and the Pakistan army under Lieutenant General Tikka Khan unleashed a reign of
terror and massacred thousands of Bengalis in a genocide codenamed ‘Operation Searchlight’.
Pakistan launched its attack against India on 03 December 1971. The Indo-Pak War of 1971
was the first war when the Indian Government engaged all three services on a large scale.Map

20 Mountain Division, under the leadership of Major General Lachhman Singh Lehl, VrC, a
distinguished veteran from the 1947 Indo-Pak conflict, was designated for operations in the
Bogra Sector. The Division comprised several infantry formations including 66 Mountain
Brigade, 165 Mountain Brigade, 202 Mountain Brigade, and 340 Mountain Brigade. Besides
these they also had three Armoured Regiments under Brigadier Armour 33 Corps, 471
Engineer Brigade, and two artillery Brigades with additional support from 33 Corps Artillery.
202 Mountain Brigade was tasked with the strategic objective of capturing Hilli, a crucial
border town in the western sector of East Pakistan.
The 202 Mountain Brigade was commanded by Brigadier Farhad Bhatti, VSM. Among its
three Infantry Battalions, 8 GUARDS was tasked with capturing the Northern defenses of
Hilli, specifically in Morapara village, with 5 GARHWAL RIFLES in reserve. The third
Battalion, 22 MARATHA LI, later secured Biagram to the North of Hilli. Support for the
attack on Morapara by 8 GUARDS included a Medium Artillery Regiment (less one Battery),
two Field Artillery Regiments, a Light Battery, and a Squadron of 63 Cavalry equipped with
T-55 tanks. Lieutenant Colonel Shamsher Singh, who earned the Mahavir Chakra (MVC) for
his actions during the Hilli operations, was the Commanding Officer of 8 GUARDS.
Hilli town was divided by the International Border, with the Indian side housing the town
itself and the Pakistani side consisting of sparse villages and open paddy fields. Surrounding
Hilli were villages like Basudeopur, Chandipur, Moaoana, and Morapara. The defenses of
Hilli were held by the 205 Infantry Brigade of the Pakistan Army. Specifically, 4 Frontier
Force (FF)troops were stationed there along with a Reconnaissance and Support Platoon from
34 PUNJAB. They were supported by six field guns of 80 Field Regiment, three M-24 tanks
from 29 Cavalry, two jeep-mounted anti-tank recoilless rifles, one Platoon of the East
Pakistan Civil Armed Forces, and around 50 Mujahids. The Pakistani forces had extensively
prepared and fortified their defenses over a long period, anticipating an assault from the
Indian side. Their positions were well entrenched and stocked, ready to withstand an Indianattack.
202 Mountain Brigade launched an attack on Hilli complex on 08 December. Held by
Pakistan’s 4 FF Battalion plus, the complex had concrete emplacements and well-coordinated
defences. The IAF assisted the attack by strafing and rocketing the defences. By the evening
of 11 December, the Pak troops were bottled up at Dangapara, just Southeast of Hilli, where
they had withdrawn from the Hilli complex. 8 GUARDS supported by one composite
Armoured Squadron, captured this position after a fierce fighting. Twenty Pak soldiers were
killed, and one officer and two ORs were captured. Besides, two Chaffee tanks and three 105
mm Howitzers were destroyed. The planned link-up between 66 Mountain Brigade and 202
Mountain Brigade was effected on 12 December.
The presence of Indian troops in the Pirganj-Palashbari area had an unsettling effect on the
border defences of Pak 205 Brigade. Figuratively, the extended Pak fingers in the north-west
and northeast were expected to fold back into a fist at Bogra, but not many troops could
manage to pull back. Similarly, the Pak Posts at Phulcharighat, Bonarpara and Gobindganj in
the east were also evacuated. After the withdrawal of 4 FF from the Hilli area, Pak 16 Infantry
Division stood divided, with 23 Infantry Brigade in the Rangpur-Dinajpur area in the North
and 205 Infantry Brigade in Bogra in the South.

Lieutenant Colonel Shamsher Singh, the Commanding Officer of 8 GUARDS, led his men
boldly in this attack and was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra for conspicuous gallantry. In the
same battle, Second Lieutenant Shamsher Singh Samra, serving as a Platoon Commander
under Major Hemant Manjrekar in A Company, faced intense and accurate enemy fire from
automatic weapons during a battle. Despite the overwhelming gunfire, he fearlessly motivated
his troops to continue their assault. Despite sustaining a serious chest wound from a Medium
Machine Gun, he bravely charged forward and neutralized the gun emplacement using agrenade. He then proceeded to attack a second bunker but was struck again by enemy fire.
Despite his injuries, he fell on the battlefield still holding the grenade. Second Lieutenant
Shamsher Singh Samra, a courageous and determined leader, sacrificed his life at the age of
26 in the line of duty. In recognition of his extraordinary bravery, he was posthumously
awarded the Maha Vir Chakra. Lance Naik RU Pandey was also awarded the Maha Vir

Punjab. He was enrolled in 9 PUNJAB of the Indian Army on 11 May 1950 at the age of
seventeen. During the Sino India War of 1962, Havildar Malkiat Singh was deployed in the
NEFA Sector where he fought the Chinese in the battle of Tseng-Jong and sacrificed himself
for the nation. He was awarded Vir Chakra posthumously.
The PUNJAB Regiment, is amongst the oldest Regiments in the Indian Army and traces its
origins back to 1805 when the First Battalion was raised under the Maharaja of Patiala.
Originally, the Regiment comprised four British-raised Battalions. The numbers and titles of
the Battalions changed during the successive reorganisations of the Madras Presidency Army,
the British Indian Army and the Indian Army during 18th, 19th and 20th Century. After the 1857,
the British applied the martial races theory and North Indian troops replaced the South Indians.
Post Independence, the PUNJAB Regiment of India was formed from the 2nd Punjab Regiment
of the British Indian Army. In 1951, four battle experienced Battalions of the former Princely
states of Punjab, joined the Regiment. These battalions were from the Jind and Nabha State
Forces and the first and second Battalions of Patiala Infantry. They were designated as the 13th,
14th, 15th and 16th battalions of the PUNJAB Regiment. Additional Battalions have been
raised since 1963. Since 1947, the PUNJAB Regiment has taken part in various battle sand
wars, winning numerous honours and awards for the same. The Regimental Centre of the
Regiment was first raised at Loralai and was shifted to Multan in 1922, Meerut in 1929 and at
last to its present location in Ramgarh, Jharkhand in 1976.1 During the Sino-India war of 1962,
the Regiment was deployed in the North-East Frontier Agency Sector (NEFA) as part of 7
Infantry Brigade of 4 Infantry Division and fought valiantly in the crucial battles in Namka
Chu Sector.
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after
its establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant
diplomatic status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state
recognition of PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into
negotiations with China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement
in 1954. Within a few weeks of Chou Enlai’s visit to India in 1954, the Chinese launched a
protest against the presence of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometers South of a Border
Pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the first time, the Government of China laid claim
to any part of Indian territory formally. The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957
marked a turning point in the Sino-India relations as the Chinese occupied a large part of the
Aksai Chin. This opened an opportunity for China to come out with territorial claims against
India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved in further into Ladakh and established

September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Post in the Eastern Sector and
began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in the Eastern Sector in Namka Chu
Sector as well as in the Western Sector in Ladakh. The overwhelming number of the Chinese
troops attacked the Indian soldiers but they fought the enemy with grit and determination. The
Chinese announced the cease-fire at midnight of 21/22 November 1962.2

During the 1962 Sino-India War, the North East Frontier Agency (NEFA) was a hub of enemy
invasions. In early September, the Government of India ordered immediate evacuation of
enemy troops from the NEFA. On 24 September Lieutenant General Umrao Singh, who was
the Corps Commander conveyed the orders to Major General Niranjan Prasad, GOC 4 Infantry
Division who then made sure that the energies of Indian Army in the area was directed to
execute “OPERATION LEGHORN”. Brigadier JP Dalvi, who was the Commander of the 7
Infantry Brigade, along with Major General Niranjan Prasad prepared a plan with a modest aim
of capturing a small feature on Thag La slopes, and Tseng-Jong, then roll down West to East
to the Chinese positions on the Namka Chu. However soon the responsibility of NEFA was
handed over to IV CORPS commanded by Lieutenant General B M Kaul, the CGS. Acting

Although Chinese response to these moves didn’t come instantly, but a strong Chinese response
came on 10 October 1962. When groups of men from 2 RAJPUT were moving up the Southern
Bank of the Namkha Chu, making for Bridge III on their way to Log Bridge - the planned
crossing point on the way to Yutso La - a full Battalion of Chinese emerged from their positions
and moved quickly down the Ridge, to form up for an attack on, Tseng-Jong. At the same time
the Indian position at Tseng-Jong came under fire from heavy mortars. At around 0800 hours
approximately 800 Chinese attacked the 9 PUNJAB position at Tseng-Jong from the East and
North-East. After a heavy exchange of fire for about 45 minutes, the attack was repulsed.
However, the enemy soon re-formed for a second time and started assaulting the position at
around 0930 Hours. A Section of 9 PUNJAB under Havildar Malkiat Singh on Karpola II hadmoved close to the flank of the Chinese. The Section opened fire on the Chinese and completely
surprised them. While the Chinese were caught in the cross-fire of Light Machine Guns and
suffered heavy casualties, they reacted and opened Heavy Mortar fire on the Section. The
Section was subsequently asked to withdraw.

crackdown and the Pakistan army under Lieutenant General Tikka Khan unleashed a reign of
terror and massacred thousands of Bengalis in a genocide codenamed ‘Operation Searchlight’.
Pakistan launched its attack against India on 03 December 1971. The Indo-Pak War of 1971
was the first war when the Indian Government engaged all three services on a large scale.Map

20 Mountain Division, under the leadership of Major General Lachhman Singh Lehl, VrC, a
distinguished veteran from the 1947 Indo-Pak conflict, was designated for operations in the
Bogra Sector. The Division comprised several infantry formations including 66 Mountain
Brigade, 165 Mountain Brigade, 202 Mountain Brigade, and 340 Mountain Brigade. Besides
these they also had three Armoured Regiments under Brigadier Armour 33 Corps, 471
Engineer Brigade, and two artillery Brigades with additional support from 33 Corps Artillery.
202 Mountain Brigade was tasked with the strategic objective of capturing Hilli, a crucial
border town in the western sector of East Pakistan.
The 202 Mountain Brigade was commanded by Brigadier Farhat Bhatty, VSM. Among its
three Infantry Battalions, 8 GUARDS was tasked with capturing the Northern defenses of
Hilli, specifically in Morapara village, with 5 GARHWAL RIFLES in reserve. The third
Battalion, 22 MARATHA LI, later secured Biagram to the North of Hilli. Support for the
attack on Morapara by 8 GUARDS included a Medium Artillery Regiment (less one Battery),
two Field Artillery Regiments, a Light Battery, and a Squadron of 63 Cavalry equipped with
T-55 tanks. Lieutenant Colonel Shamsher Singh, who earned the Mahavir Chakra (MVC) for
his actions during the Hilli operations, was the Commanding Officer of 8 GUARDS.
Hilli town was divided by the International Border, with the Indian side housing the town
itself and the Pakistani side consisting of sparse villages and open paddy fields. Surrounding
Hilli were villages like Basudeopur, Chandipur, Moaoana, and Morapara. The defenses of
Hilli were held by the 205 Infantry Brigade of the Pakistan Army. Specifically, 4 Frontier
Force (FF)troops were stationed there along with a Reconnaissance and Support Platoon from
34 PUNJAB. They were supported by six field guns of 80 Field Regiment, three M-24 tanksfrom 29 Cavalry, two jeep-mounted anti-tank recoilless rifles, one Platoon of the East
Pakistan Civil Armed Forces, and around 50 Mujahids. The Pakistani forces had extensively
prepared and fortified their defenses over a long period, anticipating an assault from the
Indian side. Their positions were well entrenched and stocked, ready to withstand an Indian
attack.
The main objective of the Indian Army was to capture Bogra, which would isolate Pakistani
forces in northern East Pakistan. The most viable route to Bogra was through Hilli. The
offensive began on the night of November 22/23 led by 202 Mountain Brigade, initiated ten
days prior to the formal declaration of war between India and Pakistan. Before the midnight
assault on November 22, Indian artillery heavily targeted Pakistani defenses, although it was
later found that the fortifications were so robust that only a few bunkers were affected by the
shelling. Around 0100 hours, amidst ongoing artillery fire, the attack commenced with two
companies from 8 GUARDS leading the charge. As Indian troops advanced towards their
objective, they encountered intense machine gun fire from well-prepared Pakistani defenses.
The Company Commanders of 8 GUARDS displayed remarkable bravery and leadership,
leading their men through challenging terrain and perilous obstacles. They fearlessly took
charge at the forefront, urging their soldiers to follow suit. Throughout the night of November
23/24, they encountered mines, barbed wire, booby traps, and waded through waist-deep
water. The combat evolved into intense hand-to-hand fighting, with the situation remaining
fluid into the early hours. Despite fierce resistance, the Pakistanis maintained control over
most of Morapara, while the Guards managed to secure only a small enclave. D Company,
commanded by Major KK Rao, received orders to capture Morapara. Lance Naik Ram Ugrah
Pandey, leading a Section of his Company, played a crucial role in these operations.
Major Rao was fatally injured by a burst from a Pakistani bunker's MMG during the battle for
Morapara, but he continued leading his men, eventually destroying the bunker himself before
succumbing to his wounds. Captain Vishnu Sharma assumed command and carried on the
fight. Lance Naik Ram Ugrah Pandey from D Company himself took the responsibility to
take down three bunkers. He closed in on the first under heavy fire, carrying grenades and at
first lobbed a grenade inside the first, blowing it up. Fired up with his first triumph, he closed
in on the second bunker and lobbed in grenades, blowing up this bunker as well. Soon, he
found an enemy Recoilless Rifle laying in the mud and picking it up, with a rocket in
breach—he fired the rocket right into the third bunker. These RCL guns are meant to crack
steel armor of tanks! The bunker was turned into a mess. But he was shot by the enemy for
being so close, which mortally wounded him. He died on the spot.
By the morning of 23 November, the situation was uncertain, with the Guards running out of
ammunition and the enemy carrying out intense shelling. The heavy T-55 tanks got bogged
down in the paddy fields and were, thus, not able to provide valuable fire support, which, if
available, would have turned the operations in the favour of the attacker. However, it was
clear that some element of the Guards had a tenuous hold in Morapara; but had to withdraw
under intense fire and shelling and, along with the rest of the battalion, organised itself at
Naopara and kept engaging the enemy.
Towards dawn, Brigadier Bhatty ordered 5 GARHWAL RIFLES to capture a locality fromwhich the Pakistanis had been supporting Morapara. In a daring assault, the Battalion
captured the enemy locality. Throughout the day on 23 November, a stalemate continued. On
the night of 23/24 November, all the three infantry battalions of 202 Mountain Brigade
carried out probing actions by vigorous patrolling and commando raids. All attempts to
achieve a breakthrough from the north and west met with stiff enemy resistance. However, by
first light of 24 November, 8 GUARDS managed to secure a foothold on the Eastern side of
Morapara and exploiting the opportunity, the Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel
Shamsher Singh quickly reinforced this foothold.
The enemy launched a counter-attack to evict this foothold; however, the Guards stood firm
and repulsed the enemy attempts with the support of artillery and tank fire of the light PT-76
tanks of 69 Armoured Regiment, which had fetched up by now, and were much more
maneuverable in comparison to the T-55 tanks. Thus, Morapara finally fell at 1000 hours on
24 November; though the casualties strewn on and around the objective told their own story
and reflected the savagery of the action.

The first Battle of Hilli, which raged before the commencement of Indo-Pak War was one of
the fiercest battles of the 1971 War. The then Army Commander, Eastern Command, Lt Gen
JS Arora, PVSM, had called Hilli the bloodiest battle in the then East Pakistan. 8 GUARDS
kept on pushing with their advance, but the Battalion lost 68 men in the Battle of Hilli—all
killed in action.

IC-1984,"Lieutenant General (Then, Brigadier)",Joginder Singh Gharaya,1 BIHAR,"Lieutenant General (then, Brigadier) Joginder Singh Gharaya was born on 31 July 1926, in
Montgomery, now in Pakistan. He did his schooling from Kings George Royal Indian
Military School (Now, Rashtriya Military School, Chail). He was commissioned into the
Frontier Force Regiment on 20 January 1946. He was transferred to 1 BIHAR post partition
as the Frontier Force Regiment was allocated to Pakistan. In 1948, during Hyderabad
annexation Lieutenant General (then, Captain) Gharaya displayed exemplary leadership and
conspicuous courage. For his contribution he was awarded Kirti Chakra (then, Ashok Chakra
II). As a Lieutenant Colonel, in 1969 Gharaya was awarded the Vishisht Seva Medal (VSM)
for distinguished service of a high order.
On 20 January 1971, he was given command of a Mountain Brigade with the acting rank of
Brigadier. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Brigadier Gharaya was commanding 42
Infantry Brigade as part of the 9 Infantry Division. For conspicuous courage and exemplary
leadership, he was awarded Maha Vir Chakra. Lieutenant General Joginder Singh Gharaya
was promoted to Major General on 30 December 1976 and subsequently commanded both
the 9 and 7 Infantry Divisions. He was promoted to Lieutenant General on 01 July 1982 and
served as Chief of Staff, Central Command before his final appointment as Director-General,
Infantry, from which post he retired from the Army in 1984. Lieutenant General Joginder
Singh Gharaya died at the age of 92 in Chandigarh on 13 July 2019.
The recruitment of soldiers from the region of Bihar dates back to the days of the British East
India Company, which raised the ‘Bengal Native Infantry’ as a force. The BIHAR
Regiment’s origin can be traced back to the sepoy battalions raised in 1775 by Lord Clive for
British East India Company at Patna. The BIHAR Regiment was formally raised in the year
1941 by regularising the 11 (Territorial) Battalion, 19 Hyderabad Regiment and raising new
battalions. Despite being among the youngest, it has displayed exemplary valour and strength
on various occasions. Their participation in World War II, Indo-Pak 1965 and 1971 is
regarded highly in the annals of history of the Indian Army.
India gained Independence in 1947, and the partition resulted in the creation of Pakistan. The
foundation of Pakistan was laid by the Muslim League based on the two-nation theory.
Pakistan comprised two wings- East and West Pakistan which were geographically separated
by 1600 kms Indian territory. The two wings of Pakistan were culturally and linguistically
different and the diversities between the two wings could not be bridged by an emotional
appeal to religion. Consequently, fissures started erupting in the political body of Pakistan
soon after the Independence and with each passing year it widened. In the absence of
appropriate defence arrangements, the people of East Pakistan felt isolated and abandoned.
Finally, the malfeasance of Pakistani leadership during Cyclone Bhola and the overwhelming
support for the Awami League in the 1970 elections, proved the proverbial last straw on thecamel’s back.1 The Awami League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (of East Pakistan) secured
an absolute majority in the general elections held in December 1970. This entitled the League
to form a Government in Pakistan. However, Pakistan’s military rulers denied this democratic
right to the Awami League, in connivance with the PPP, led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. This
arbitrary act of government caused deep resentment among the population of East Pakistan
resulting in widespread protests. When the slide became unmanageable, the Pakistani rulers
resorted to a midnight crackdown on 25 March 1971. The government ordered a military
crackdown and the Pakistan army under Lieutenant General Tikka Khan unleashed a reign of
terror and massacred thousands of Bengalis in a genocide code-named ‘Operation
Searchlight’. Pakistan launched its attack against India on 03 December 1971. The Indo-Pak
War of 1971 was the first war when the Indian Government engaged all three services on a
large scale. India unfolded its plan of attack in East Pakistan following pre-emptive air strikes
from Pakistan on 03 December 1971. Jessore was one of the most fortified positions in East-
Pakistan. The Indian II Corps was pitted against Pakistan’s force in the Jessore-Jhenida
sector.
As per the Corps plan, 9 Infantry Division was tasked to capture Jessore and then assist 4
Mountain Division in the capture of Magura. On 03 December, the Division had managed to
cover almost half way to Jessore and was in contact with Pakistani defences West of Jessore.
Pakistan had deployed nearly four battalions to defend this area.The Indian objective was to
seek a breakthrough. Pressure was, therefore, maintained all along the front to keep the
Pakistanis guessing about the approach of Indian Troops. On 04 December, it was decided to
clear the Northern approach at Durgabarkati. As a preliminary, 14 PUNJAB secured Charbari
on 05 December. The attack was finally launched on 06 December 1971.
On 06 December, 1971, Brigadier JS Gharaya was in command of 42 Infantry Brigade in
the Jessore Sector. His Brigade was attacked four times in a row, but despite suffering severe
casualties, his troops managed to hold the line, due to his superb tactical handling,
exceptional bravery, constant presence, and leadership. His conduct of this operation was
responsible for heavy enemy losses and their withdrawal. Brigadier Gharaya was among the
leading forces during the next offensive operations when he was severely wounded by enemy
fire. He refused to be evacuated till he had seen the attack through as the success of this
attack was vital to our further advance in Bangladesh.
Throughout this operation, Brigadier Gharaya conducted himself with extraordinary courage
and through his personal example inspired such spirit and confidence among troops that led
to the complete success of the difficult operations.
For his conspicuous courage and unflinching devotion to duty he was awarded Maha Vir
Chakra.

district of Maharashtra. He was enrolled into the 15 MARATHA LI on 13 February 1969.
During the Indo-Pak War of 1971, Sepoy Salunkhe’s battalion, 15 MARATHA LI, was
deployed on the Western front in the Amrtisar Sector of Punjab. He was awarded the Maha
Vir Chakra for his exceptional bravery, indomitable spirit and supreme sacrifice in the Battle
of Burj.
The MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY was formed as the 103rd Mahrattas in 1768, making it
the senior most Light Infantry Regiment of the Army. Their Regimental Centre has been
Belgaum, Karnataka, since 1922. The battle cry of the MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY is,
‘Bol Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj ki Jai!’ (Cry Victory to Emperor Shivaji!) in tribute to
the Maratha Emperor Shivaji. Indian independence saw the Regiment reverting to the original
five battalions, with the 3 MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY converting to the airborne role
and becoming 2 PARA in April 1952. With the integration of the erstwhile Princely States,
the 19th, 20th, 22nd battalions were amalgamated, from the State Forces of Kolhapur, Baroda,
and Hyderabad, with the Regiment. The expansion of the Indian Army to meet the
omnipresent threat to its borders has seen the Regiment grow to its present total of 18
battalions and two TA battalions whilst the period also saw the conversion of 21st Bn into 21
Para (Special Forces) and the 115 Infantry battalion (TA) being grouped under the MAHAR
Regiment. The five Mahavir Chakras and the numerous other war and peace time gallantry
awards bear testimony to the front-line leadership and courage of the Regiment’s Officers,
JCOs and NCOs. Gen JJ Singh (9th and 5th) who became the Chief of Army Staff in Feb
2005 was from the Maratha Light Infantry and was also the Colonel of the Regiment. During
the 1947-48 Indo-Pak war, 3 (PARA) MARATHA LIGHT INFANTRY was a part of 50 Para
Brigade commanded by Brigadier Usman Mohammad. The battalion participated in the
crucial battles of Jhangar and Naushera.
The 1971 War was a military conflict between India and Pakistan during the Bangladesh
Liberation War from 03 to 16 December, 1971. India gained Independence in 1947, and the
partition resulted in the creation of Pakistan. It began with preemptive airstrikes by the
Pakistan Air Force on Indian targets, leading to India’s involvement in support of Bengali
nationalist forces. Pakistan suffered a significant defeat in this War. The Indo-Pak War of
1971 was the first war when the Indian Government engaged all three services on a large
scale. A total of 4090 Indian soldiers made supreme sacrifice during this war and about 600
officers and men of the Indian Armed Forces were decorated with Gallantry awards. Of these,
04 were Param Vir Chakra, 76 Maha Vir Chakra and 513 Vir Chakra. 15 MARATHA LIGHT
INFANTRY won the Battle Honour Burj and the Theatre Honour Punjab during the 1971
War.
The Punjab Sector, which included Punjab, Haryana and the Ganganagar District of Rajasthan
was the responsibility of the XI Corps commanded by Lieutenant General NC Rawlley,
PVSM, AVSM,MC under the overall command of Lieutenant General KP Candeth, PVSM
GOC-in-C, Western Command. The area of responsibility of the XI Corps thus extended over
640 km along the international border. Its Main HQ was at Amritsar from where it controlled
the Northern half of the Sector. The skeleton Advance HQ at Kot Kapura looked after the area
south of the river Satluj. The Corps led by Lt Gen NC Rawlley, PVSM, consisted of three
independent Sectors. It had assigned the following defended Sectors to its formations:The 15 Infantry Division under Maj Gen BM Bhattacharjea, MVC was to defend the Amritsar
Sector, including the prominent towns of Amritsar, Dera Baba Nanak and Ajnala. Its Brigades
were deployed as follows:
86 Infantry Brigade in Dera Baba Nanak area
58 Infantry Brigade in Ajnala area
96 Infantry Brigade in Fatehpur-Burj area
54 Infantry Brigade in Atari-Ranian area
38 Infantry Brigade in Neshta-Rajatal area
The 96 Infantry Brigade was given the responsibility of defending the area between Chann
Malla and Bhindi Aulakh in the North-West of Amritsar. Across the Ravi, Pakistan had a
sizeable enclave at Fatehpur and Bhago-Kamo and it could establish a Bridgehead there and
pose a threat to Amritsar. The Indian Army, therefore, decided to capture the enclave.
On the night of 03/04 December 1971 Pakistan inducted the major part of their 88 Infantry
Brigade belonging to 17 Infantry Division into this enclave and under pressure from this force
the Border Security Force was forced to vacate Ghoge, Behlol, Gulgarh, Burj and our
Fatehpur Posts. The Border Security Force, thus withdrawn, were re-deployed further back at
Vara and the defences there were strengthened by the induction of two Platoons of 15
Maratha and one Troop of 66 Armoured Regiment equipped with Vijayantha tanks with
orders that there would be no further withdrawal.
Orders were then issued to 15 MARATHA LI to attack Tur and Burj and a Troop of tanks
were placed under command for the attack. Before the attack could be launched a Company
of 43 Baluch attacked Bhindi Aulak from Tur. The plan had therefore to be altered: to first
contain the Pakistani attack. The attack was beaten back by Indian Artillery and armour and
the attackers fled leaving behind their dead and some arms and ammunitions.Source: Infantry, A Glint of the Bayonet by Directorate General of Infantry
The attack was finally put in by Major Ranbir Singh, the Second-in-Command, with two
companies, on 06 December 1971. The enemy taking shelter in bunkers bought down heavy
fire on the assaulting troops. A close fight ensued. The Marathas fought their way doggedly
from bunker to bunker physically. In many cases the enemy was dispossessed of his weapons
forcibly. When fierce battle was going on, an enemy Rocket Launcher was found posing a
threat to Indian tanks and infantry. Sepoy Pandurang Salunkhe decided to eliminate this
threat. He charged the enemy, killed the operator and physically snatched away the Rocket
Launcher. But in this bold charge he himself received a burst of sten gun fire at point blank
range and fell dead. But the great sacrifice did not go in vain. It enabled the Marathas to
recapture Burj and paved the way for the success of 96 Infantry Brigade.
The soldiers of the 15 MARATHA LI beat the enemy and, in the process, badly mauled 43
Baluch, who left behind 53 bodies, besides a large quantity of arms, ammunition and
equipment.Sepoy Pandurang Salunkhe’s statue

Sepoy Salunkhe displayed outstanding courage and determination during the battle and laid
down his life at the age of 22 years in the line of his duty. Sepoy Pandurang Salunke was
given the nation’s second highest gallantry award, Maha Vir Chakra for his exceptional
bravery, indomitable spirit, and supreme sacrifice.

During an assault by a battalion of the Maratha Light Infantry, supported by armour, an
enemy rocket launcher posed a threat to the tanks assaulting with the infantry. Realizing the
danger to our tanks, Sepoy Pandurang Salunkhe, at great risk to his life, charged towards the
rocket launcher, jumped on the enemy, and physically snatched away the rocket launcher even
though he received a burst of stengun fire at pointblank range.
In this action, Sepoy Salunkhe displayed indomitable courage and determination of a very

Annapurna Natu, in Akola District of Maharashtra. He was born on the auspicious day of Anant
Chaturdashi and was therefore named Anant. Brigadier Natu’s belonged to a middle-class
family, at the time of his birth, the family of six lived in a small room in Akola. He had two
elder brothers, Sadashiv and Vasant, who helped the family by running a shop at the Sunday
market in the city. As a child, Brigadier Natu was thin, at ten he started contributing in his own
ways. He began his education in the nearby Municipality school in Marathi medium. After his
matriculation exam, in 1942, his father decided to send him to Nagpur for further studies. At

completed his intermediate examination in 1944 from Hislop College, Nagpur. In 1944,
Brigadier Natu was selected to join the Royal Air Force, but he was found medically unfit for
the Air Force and instead was given the option to join the Indian Army. He accepted the offer
and did his training from Officer Training Academy Banglore and was posted to 13th Frontier
Force Rifles at Abbottabad in October 1946. After independence, he was posted to 1/9
GORKHA RIFLES.
Another officer who had served in the Frontier Force Rifles before independence and joined
1/9 GORKHA RIFLES was Eric A Vas. He was four years senior to Lt Anant Natu. Later,
General Natu described his relationship with Eric Vas, “Eric (who later rose to the rank of
Lieutenant General and Army Commander) was a Major in the Battalion. He was a friend,
philosopher, and guide throughout my life.” Lieutenant Anant was commanding Delta
Company of 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES through 1948 and 1949 in the Naushera Sector. The first
Battalion of 9 GORKHA RIFLES handed over its defences in Naushera to 6/5 GORKHA
RIFLES in the middle of July 1949 and left for Pathankot. The Battalion remained at Ferozpur
for five years. On return to Ferzopur, Captain Natu’s company was deployed on the Indo-
Pakistan border on the river Sutlej.

commitment and physical fitness shown by Major Anant Natu. Major Anant Natu was
promoted to the rank of Lt Col and took over the command of the battalion from Lt Col Nasib
Singh on 14 August 1964.
The first battalion of Gurkha Regiment (now Gorkha Rifles) was raised in 1815 during the
Anglo-Nepalese war. Impressed by the qualities displayed by Gurkhas during the war, the
British started active recruitment of Gurkhas into the British Indian army. After the partition,
in 1947 six Gurkha regiments viz, 1 GR, 3 GR, 4 GR, 5 GR, 8 GR and 9 GR remained with the
Indian Army, while 2 GR, 6 GR, 7 GR and 10 GR were transferred to British Army as part of
the Tripartite Agreement signed between India, Nepal and Britain. The 9 GORKHA RIFLES

Regiment a regular unit as part of the Bengal Native Infantry. Following the reorganisation
after 1857, the designation was changed to 9th Bengal Native Infantry with one of its
Companies formed by Gorkhas and other hillmen. In 1893, the regiment became a wholly
Gorkha unit before finally designated as 9th GORKHA RIFLES in 1903. The Regiment fought
in Europe during World War I and in Italy and North West Frontier during World War II. Since
independence, the Regiment has proved its mettle in Sino-India War of 1962 where it fought
under the most demanding conditions on the Namka Chu in NEFA (Now Arunachal Pradesh).
Later, the Regiment was also involved in Indo-Pak War of 1965 and 1971. 1 The Regiment’s
motto is ‘Kafar Hunu Bhanda Marnu Ramro’ (Better to die than live like a coward). In the
Sino-India war of 1962, the regiment was posted in the North-East Frontier Agency Sector
(NEFA) and fought valiantly in the crucial battles in Namka Chu Sector. The Gorkha’s have
contributed many Chiefs to the Indian Army these include General SHFJ Manekshaw , MC
who went on to become India’s first Field Marshal, General GG Bewoor PVSM, PB, General

India gained Independence in 1947, and the partition resulted in the creation of Pakistan. The
foundation of Pakistan was laid by the Muslim League based on the two-nation theory. Pakistan
comprised two wings- East and West Pakistan which were geographically separated by 1600
kms Indian territory. The two wings of Pakistan were culturally and linguistically different and
the diversities between the two wings could not be bridged by an emotional appeal to religion.
Consequently, fissures started erupting in the political body of Pakistan soon after the
Independence and with each passing year it widened. In the absence of appropriate defence
arrangements, the people of East Pakistan felt isolated and abandoned. Finally, the malfeasance
of Pakistani leadership during Cyclone Bhola and the overwhelming support for the Awami
League in the 1970 elections, proved the proverbial last straw on the camel’s back.2 The
Awami League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (of East Pakistan) secured an absolute majority
in the general elections held in December 1970. This entitled the League to form a Government
in Pakistan. However, Pakistan’s military rulers denied this democratic right to the AwamiLeague, in connivance with the PPP, led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. This arbitrary act of
government caused deep resentment among the population of East Pakistan resulting in
widespread protests. When the slide became unmanageable, the Pakistani rulers resorted to a
midnight crackdown on 25 March 1971. The government ordered a military crackdown and
the Pakistan army under Lieutenant General Tikka Khan unleashed a reign of terror and
massacred thousands of Bengalis in a genocide codenamed ‘Operation Searchlight’. Pakistan
launched its attack against India on 03 December 1971. The Indo-Pak War of 1971 was the
first war when the Indian Government engaged all three services on a large scale.
In December 1947, 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES was ordered to proceed to Jammu and Kashmir to
fight the raiders. The Battalion reached Jammu on 05 December 1947, and was ordered to move
to Akhnoor the next day. Brigadier Natu, a young Lieutenant then, was the Mechanised
Transport Officer and had ensured that all the vehicles reach Jammu without any problems.
After the Battalion was concentrated at Akhnoor on the banks of Chenab, he was made
Company Commander. 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES saw action during 1948 and 1949 in the
Naushera Sector.
After he completed his three years’ tenure as Military and Air Attaché in the Indian Embassy
at Kathmandu, Nepal in 1969, he took over as Commander 93 Infantry Brigade at Poonch.
The Brigade was the northern most Sector of 25 Infantry Division. The Poonch Sub Sector has
one of the most difficult terrain south of Pir Panjal Range. Brigadier Natu knew that it was
extremely essential for a commander to know in detail the terrain in which his formation was
deployed. This was necessary because 93 Infantry Brigade was spread over a varied type of
terrain. `Poonch Sub Sector can be divided into three parts: high altitude, medium altitude and
low altitude. The area east of Doda is high altitude and ranges from 3000 meters to 3800 meters
in height and is covered with forests. The area between Doda/ Darungli Nala and Betar Nala is
of medium altitude, and the area West of Betar N in the East to Poonch River in the South and
dominates the Poonch town.Terrain

On 03 December 1971, Pakistan opened Western Front with wide-spread pre-emptive strikes
to gain impetus for the ground attacks that were to follow. At 0500 hours on the same day, two
Pakistani aircraft flew over Poonch and fired a few rockets at the administrative base of 6 SIKH
causing some damage. Pakistan’s 12 Infantry Division had launched its offensive against 93
Infantry Brigade attacking the Durga, Banwat and Doda defences with the aim to capture
Poonch. Throughout the night of 03 and 04 December, there was heavy shelling by enemy on
all forward picquets.
Gulpur Subsector
At 2000 hours, on 03 December, Pakistan started heavy shelling of the Gulpur, Banwat and
Doda. By 2030 hrs the mortar of 1/4 GORKHA RIFLES also started engaging the Pakistani
troops while Indian artillery pounded the Pakistan position. In the Gulpur Battalion defended
area Pakistan attacked twice. The first attack on the Langoor position overran the listening
posts and penetrated the entrance but 1/4 GORKHA RIFLES, assisted by artillery, repulsed the
attack, and drove the attackers out. The second attack was launched in the early hours of 04
December, was also repulsed by 0300 hours.
Banwat SubsectorThe Banwat Sector included a hill complex that dominated the Poonch town. The defence of
this Sector was necessary to protect the town from the East and North-East. Picquets 405, which
covered Tund and Helipad. This Picquets and Picquets 406 and 406A were considered grounds
of tactical importance and 6 SIKH was tasked to defend the area. To the south of 6 SIKH, 8
JAT were located. It was put under the command of the 93 Infantry Brigade to give depth to
the defences of 6 SIKH.
Pakistan was well prepared to attack the Indian Brigade from the north-eastern side. Chand
Tekri and Munawari Tekri, nicknamed Raja and Rani, were two vital positions held by
Pakistanis in the area. 6 SIKH had anticipated an attack because of the Pakistani build up and
the development of a road from Kahuta to Rani Picquets. Therefore, it had taken necessary
measures to give depth to the defences. As expected, the Pakistanis launched an attack on
Helipad and Tund on the night of 03/04 December, with three battalions. The Helipad fell to
Pakistani troops at 1030 hours. In the view of mounting threat, two platoons of 8 JAT were
sent to reinforce. The attacker tried to isolate the area at 1500 hours by inserting troops between
Point 405 and Point 406, but the attempt was foiled by artillery and MMG fire.
Pakistani troops resumed the offensive on the night of 04/05 December, the attack was once
again beaten back by air strikes and effective shelling. They could not make any further
advances due to effective MMG and LMG fire. Artillery shelling continued from the Pakistani
side also. All Pakistani efforts failed and 6 SIKH cleared the area North-East of Tund and
Kasba Spur. Heavy Pakistani losses made them withdrew from Helipad at 0500 hours on 06
December 1971. The Helipad was reoccupied at 0900 hours by two platoons of 6 SIKH. The
attacker tried to occupy Helipad again on 07 and 09 December, both attacks were repulsed.
6 SIKH and 8 JAT had fought with conspicuous courage and determination and foiled the
Pakistani plan to take Poonch.
Doda Sub-Sector
11 JAK Militia was deployed in the Doda Sector, to the east of Dorungli Nala. Gutrian and
Shahpur were two vital positions held by ‘D’ coy. On 03 December 1971, Pakistan started its
offensive with the shelling of these positions at 1930 hours. Two attacks on Gutrian were
beaten back, the third attack came at 0230 hours on 04 December. Indian troops responded
with heavy shelling and small arms fire. The Pakistani troops attacked Shahpur with two
companies at 2030 hours on 03 Decembee, even when the attack on Gutrian was in progress.
All of the attacks were beaten back, including the three attempts made to capture the Shahpur
Picquet and the Shahpur OP.
Battle of Thanpir
On the night of 03/04 December, as the battle was raging in other Sectors of the Brigade,
Brigadier Anant Natu had spoken with the Company Commander of Thanpir Company to be
vigilant and alert. Brigadier Natu took permission from the Division Commander to move two
companies of the Division Reserve Battalion to Kalai Bridge. On 04 December 1971, at 0615
hours, Pakistani Force penetrated through the 11 JAK Militia Defended Area and surroundedthe Thanpir post with strength of two-three companies, the post fell to the enemy by 0800
hours. The Pakistani also occupied the Chandak village. The occupation of Thanpir by Pak
troops endangered Poonch and the Brigade defended sector including Rajauri and Mandi
valleys, and also threatened the strategic Kalai bridge, the lifeline of the Brigade.
13 MAHAR, which had been moved to Kalai Bridge Area, was ordered to attack and capture
Thanpir. ‘A’ and ‘D’ Companies of the Battalion concentrated at Chandak and commenced the
assault at 1500 hours on 04 December. The Chandak Spur was cleared of the infiltrators in
about two hours. At 0700 hours, on 05 December, the Battalion was ordered to capture Thanpir.
The operation for the capture of Thanpir started at 0800 hours. The assault echelon (""A' coy)
moved along the knife-edge ridge from Chandak to Thanpir to avoid enemy fire. Another
company moved from the Chandak Spur to the northeast. Both companies finally converged
on Thanpir from the south. A BSF company climbed up the spur and posed a threat from the
eastern flank. A Para Commando Group climbed along the Nagali Spur, to threaten the
stronghold from the west.
As Pakistanis did not expect an attack along this precipitous slope, they were taken by surprise.
Thanpir was captured by the Indians at 1800 hrs on 5 December, thus removing the threat to
Punch from the east. Pakistanis fled, leaving behind 20 dead, and many arms and ammunition,
including one recoilless gun of Chinese make. The body of Lt Col Nazir Ahmed Khan, the CO
of 26 POK Battalion, was recovered along with the body of Maj Javed, his Battery Commander.

Education was very dear to General Natu. He and Mrs Natu started a kindergarten school in
their house. They constructed a room on the balcony of their house for this purpose and named
the school Vivekananda Balak Mandir. He also started a school project in the town. The school
would have classes till standard 10. They decided to name the school Gurukul. Furthermore,
General Natu became the president of the All-India Consumer Forum, Chalisgaon Chapter. He
made consistent efforts to educate the consumers about their rights and duties. General Natu
also decided to contribute to prevent/minimise the adverse effects of global warming. He
bought 3-acre land and planted trees, mostly tamarind, to help absorb a bit of the carbon gases
emitted by excessive industrial activity. General Natu tried to spread the message of global
warming and highlighted to the people about its adverse effects.Bust of Brigadier Anant V Natu, MVC installed at Udampur.

Kunzang Dorje and Mrs Jamyang Dolma. Chewang Rinchen could have spent his entire life in the
remote village of Sumur at the confluence of the Shyok and Nubra rivers. But the visit of the Kalon
(minister) of Ladakh changed the course of his life. The official spotted the spark in the 13-year
boy and after gaining the approval of his parents, decided to take him to Leh to educate him.
Chewang Rinchen had a younger brother P Namgyal, who went on to become a popular activist
and politician of the region. He was a union minister, three times Member of Parliament and
Member of Legislative Council of Leh.

(Source: Blogspot Claude Apri)Four years later, following operation Datta Khel, which saw the revolt by Major Brown in Gilgit,
Pakistan under Major Aslam Khan (carrying the pseudo name Colonel Pasha) organised three
forces, Ibex, Tiger and Eskimo to head for Skardu and Leh; Gurez and Bandipora; and Kargil and
Zoji La. As there was only 6 J&K Infantry deployed between Leh and Bhunji, of which a majority
were Muslim soldiers, who joined Pakistan, Major Sher Jung Thapa moved the balance troops to
Skardu, while a column of 2 Dogra under Major Prithi Chand walked to Leh from Srinagar on 16
February 1948 through heavy snow and blizzards, with undaunted courage and determination.
Arriving at Leh on 8 March 1948, they soon lowered the Union Jack and raised the Indian flag at
Karzo Palace on 13 March, with the chanting of hymns by lamas and asked for local volunteers to
join them. Colonel Chhewang Rinchen, who was only seventeen years old then, was the first
person to volunteer.
In May 1948, tribal raiders from Pakistan captured Kargil, leaving Leh susceptible to further raids,
and possible occupation. With the passage of winter came melting snow and open mountain passes,
paving the way for tribal raiders from Pakistan to converge on Leh. Their mission was driven by
the promise of hidden treasures and wealth stored in Buddhist monasteries and the belief that the
peace-loving people of the region weren’t capable of fighting back. There was no significant Indian
army presence in the region. Among those defending Ladakh then, were 33 men of the J&K State
Forces, a Leh-based garrison, along with a team of 20 volunteers led by Lieutenant Colonel Prithi
Chand, who had crossed the extremely harsh climes of the wind-swept Zoji La pass in winter with
his band of men. in one of the most daring operations of the 1947-1948 War, Captain Prithi Chand
and a few of his Lahauli companions saved Leh by reaching the Ladakhi capital before the
Pakistani raiders. They had done the impossible, crossing the Zojila pass in winter. The captain
soon became the mentor of the young Rinchen, who underwent a short military training under him.
Rinchen then recruited twenty-eight of his friends from the Nubra Valley and after undergoing 13
days of training, the Nubra Volunteer Force was created. They played a crucial role in the win of
1947-1948 War.
The first Indo-Pak war fought between the independent countries of India and Pakistan began in
1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan were the attempts by Pakistan to annex
the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. On the map of India, the state of Jammu
and Kashmir appeared as a somewhat rectangular projection in the extreme North-West corner of
the sub-continent. In size it was the largest of the Indian ‘Princely States’ during the pre-
independence era. It was 222,870 sq km or roughly double the area of Demark, the Netherlands,
Belgium and Luxemburg combined. The state was important because of its strategic location. Even
before the birth of Pakistan, Jammu and Kashmir was surrounded on almost three sides by foreign
states. Today, its importance has been accentuated by recent international developments. To the
East lay Tibet; to its North lies Chinese Turkestan or Sinkiang (Xinjiang); to West is Afghanistan;to South-West and South was Pakistan; and to the South and South-East lay the states of Punjab
and Himachal Pradesh of India.1 The narrow Wakhan corridor, a narrow strip of territory in
Afghanistan, extending to China and separating Tajikistan from Gilgit-Baltistan, was to the North
West. Some of the significant battles that took place in Jammu and Kashmir were, the Battle of
Badgam, capture and recapture of Jhangar, battle of Naushera, the advance to Tithawal, the relief
in Punch and the fight of Chhamb to Tithwal. The Nubra Volunteer Force fighting in the icy
treacherous terrain of Leh and Ladakh, played a crucial role in the win of 1947-1948 War.
On 01 June 1948, Colonel Chhewang Richen and his column set out on a nine-day march over
treacherous terrain crossing the Karakorams; with pieces of cloth tied to their feet as their shoes
had given way, and attacked an enemy position at Chumik La on 10 June, killing 20 enemy
soldiers, keeping up the pressure they soon captured Dzongpolas. By 12 July, once the invaders
had reached Nimu, literally at Leh’s doorstep and it was decided to pull back the troops from Nubra
Valley, Chhewang realising that this area would fall, organised the defence of Nubra Valley with
local volunteers and soon marched to Skuru. On 25 August 1948, he was formally recruited into 7
J&K Militia as a Jemadar, since a non-Matric could not be made an officer. One of his major
successes in September 1948 was the capture of Lama House, located at 4,500 meters, where
taking advantage of bad weather and in an approach, march lasting many days devoid of any path
or track attacked the post through heavy snow captured the objective after killing 10 enemy
soldiers. In December 1948, he was instrumental in clearing “Black Rock” with his “Nonnos”
(name affectionately given to the soldiers of Nubra Volunteer Force by the locals of Nubra Valley).
In August 1948, the enemy had engaged all of his reserves to seizing the Nubra Valley. At Kharu
Nullah, Colonel (Then Jemedar) Chewang Rinchen kept the enemy at bay for 23 days with just 18
untrained nationals. He was assigned to seize the enemy position at Lama House in September
1948. This was a very challenging task that required a four-day march across dangerous terrain,
including crossing a mountain peak that was over 17000 feet high. He was able to take the target
with significant enemy casualties and the capture of three firearms. When given the mission to
take control of a hill feature close to Biagdangdo. On 15 December, he walked through snow for
three days and was able to drive the enemy away. Again, on 22 December 1948, he was assigned
to attack the enemy's last position in the Leh tehsil Region. In the span of just six days, he
succeeded in completing his mission. Even though a large portion of his unit suffered from frost
bite casualties while crossing a 23000-foot mountain feature, he maintained his soldiers moving
forward with his excellent and great leadership. He attacked the opponent's station and overran it,
heavily damaging the adversary in the process. Under the most challenging circumstances, this

Colonel Chewang Richen married his wife Mrs Chhukit Dolma on 01 June 1950 at the age of
eighteen. The couple had five children, four daughters and one son. Dr Phunsog Angmo being the
eldest was born in 1956, followed by Dechan Angmo (1957), Tundup Dolma (1961), Sonam
Dolkar (1966), Tsering Angmo (1968), finally their son Richen Wangchuk in 1969. As a devoted
soldier, he wanted his son to join the Indian Army and serve the nation. However, his son Rinchen
Wangchuk chose wildlife conservation and excelled in the field. He was co-founder of Snow
Leopard Conservatory in the Himalayan belt. Unfortunately, he was diagnosed with a rare and
uncurable Motor Neuron Disease and passed away in 2011. He is survived by his wife, son and a
daughter.
Colonel Chewang Rinchen was promoted to the rank of Subedar in 7 J&K Militia at the age of
twenty-five years. In 1959, he was deployed in north of Batalik, when a CRPF patrol was
ambushed in Hot Springs. He then force-marched all the way to Leh in just four days. Tasked to
set up posts over a vast and difficult terrain along the southern bank of Pangong Tso and carry outprobing and patrolling, he saluted and said “Julley”. Covering over 400 km and crossing passes
such as Chang La in peak winter, in almost uncharted territory, the Nonnos successfully carried
out their mission. In these actions, Subedar Chewang Rinchen displayed personal bravery,
resourcefulness, leadership, and dedication of duty of a high order. Later in June 1960, he was
commission as a Second Lieutenant in Indian Army. He was first commissioned officer from the
region. He was posted in 14 Jammu and Kashmir Militia which later turned into Ladakh Scouts.
The Ladakh Scouts known as the “Snow Warriors” were initially raised as a paramilitary force
formed of the Ladakhi locals known as Nubra Guards to save Ladakh from intruders in 1948. It
comprised of Ladakhi locals who are physically fit and attuned with the rugged terrain and hostile
climate. In 1952, the Nubra Guards were merged as the 7th Battalion of the Jammu & Kashmir
Militia, which later became the Jammu & Kashmir Light Infantry (JAKLI) Regiment. The Ladakh
Scouts was raised in 1963, following the Indo China War of 1962. It was formed by spinning off
the 7th and 14th battalions of J&K MILITIA. LADAKH SCOUTS had two wings- the Karakoram
Wing, defending the eastern front facing China and the Indus Wing facing Pakistan. They fought
in the 1965 and 1971 India Pakistan War and were also part of Operation Meghdoot in 1984. The
also played a significant role by marking one of the earliest victories during the Kargil War of
1999. The Ladakh Scouts was converted into a regiment in the year 2000 and currently consists of
5 battalions.
In 1962, he was part of a patrol to Sumdo, where they established a post at 4,998 meters and
reconnoitered a direct route between Sumdo and Daulat Beg Oldi. On one occasion they walked
non-stop for 18 hours through an unknown snow covered stretch, as a result of which they were
disoriented and all they had to eat was sattu and the water had to be extracted from ice. Unknown
to them they spent the night next to a Chinese post. Such missions aimed to check the Chinese
intrusions and then establish small posts opposite them though these had negligible defence
potential. There is no doubt that the Nonnos could outrun and outclimb any Chinese conscript. He
was awarded a Sena medal for his brave actions during the war.
During the 1965 War with Pakistan, he was deployed in DBO as a Captain, from where he marched
to Partapur, covering a distance which normally takes ten days in half the time taking no halts. He
was, therefore, called “the Lion of Nubra”. He conducted long-range patrols into Baltistan and
though they planned to capture Turtuk and Chulunkha, the plans were not executed due to the
China factor. He then raised additional Nubra Guards and crossing Saser Brangsa La at an
unbelievable pace on 25 September 1965 they arrived at the Tri-Junction mainly due to his
indefatigable spirit and unflagging stamina. His contributions were duly recognised but because
of lack of actual combat he was only Mentioned-in-Despatches.In the India-Pak War of 1971, Colonel (then Major) Chewang Rinchen was with Nubra Guards, a
part of 3 Infantry Division commanded by Major General (later Lieutenant General) S.P. Malhotra.

The Indo-Pak War of 1971 was the first war when the Indian Government engaged all three
services on a large scale. India unfolded its plan of attack in East Pakistan following pre-emptive
air strikes from Pakistan on 03 December 1971.
During the 1971 war, Colonel (then Major) Chewang Rinchen was commanding the force assigned
the task to capture the Chalunka complex of enemy defenses in the Partappur Sector which entailed
capturing Point 18402. On the light of 08 December 1971, he along with In an extremely cold
night he along with Major Thapa and Major Ahluwalia’s troops stormed this formidable feature,
They killing five Pakistani soldiers and capturing one. Each of the nine enemy strong points were
held by one to two platoons and fortified with mines and wire obstacles. This operation was
planned and executed with professional competence and great zeal. Under most adverse weather
conditions, when pinned down by accurate and intense fire from MMGs, two brave Nonnos
crawled forward and silenced the enemy bunkers by lobbing grenades. Ultimately, they captured
44 prisoners of war and then went on to seize Turtok on 13 and Thang by 16 December 1971.
During the action Major Rinchen led his command with great leadership, displaying aggressive
spirit, fighting from bunker to bunker, exhorting, and encouraging his men to destroy the enemy
thus making the operation a complete success. In this action, Major Chewang Rinchen displayed
inspiring leadership, indomitable courage, initiative and exceptional devotion to duty in the highest
traditions of the Indian Army and was awarded Maha Vir Chakra, the second time.

The Corps of Signals was formed after a notification was issued as a Special Army Order dated
February 3, 1911, for the Organisation of two Signal Companies, this led to the formation of
first Signal Units, 31st and 32nd Divisional Signal Companies. The Units were raised at
Fatehgarh in present day Uttar Pradesh. Lieutenant Colonel SH Powell, Royal Engineers, was
the founder and first head of the Indian Signal Service, which later became the Indian Signal
Corps. Previously, battlefield communications were managed by the Sappers within the Indian
Army Corps of Engineers, established in 1777. The Corps expanded with the formation of the
33rd and 34th Divisional Signal Companies in Ahmednagar, and the beginning of the 41st
Wireless Squadron in Roorkee on March 1, 1911. Following India's independence in 1947,
Brigadier CHI Acehurst became its first head. Post the wars of 1965 and 1971, the Corps
underwent significant growth, receiving regimental colours on February 20, 1965, and again on
February 15, 1981.
India gained Independence in 1947, and the partition resulted in the creation of Pakistan. The
foundation of Pakistan was laid by the Muslim League based on the two-nation theory. Pakistan
comprised two wings- East and West Pakistan which were geographically separated by 1600
kms Indian territory. The two wings of Pakistan were culturally and linguistically different and
the diversities between the two wings could not be bridged by an emotional appeal to religion.
Consequently, fissures started erupting in the political body of Pakistan soon after the
Independence and with each passing year it widened. In the absence of appropriate defence
arrangements, the people of East Pakistan felt isolated and abandoned. Finally, the malfeasance
of Pakistani leadership during Cyclone Bhola and the overwhelming support for the Awami
League in the 1970 elections, proved the proverbial last straw on the camel’s back.2 The Awami
League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (of East Pakistan) secured an absolute majority in the
general elections held in December 1970. This entitled the League to form a Government in
Pakistan. However, Pakistan’s military rulers denied this democratic right to the Awami
League, in connivance with the PPP, led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. This arbitrary act ofgovernment caused deep resentment among the population of East Pakistan resulting in
widespread protests. When the slide became unmanageable, the Pakistani rulers resorted to a
midnight crackdown on 25 March 1971. The government ordered a military crackdown and the
Pakistan army under Lieutenant General Tikka Khan unleashed a reign of terror and massacred
thousands of Bengalis in a genocide codenamed ‘Operation Searchlight’. Pakistan launched its
attack against India on 03 December 1971. The Indo-Pak War of 1971 was the first war when
the Indian Government engaged all three services on a large scale.
On 05 December, 1971, the 86 Infantry Brigade, led by Brigadier Gowri Shankar, received
orders to eliminate the Pakistani bridgehead across the River Ravi, North of Dera Baba Nanak.
Dera Baba Nanak, situated approximately 40 kilometers North of Amritsar, holds strategic
significance due to Indian and Pakistani enclaves located North and South of River Ravi. The
Indian enclave is called Kasowal and the Pakistani enclave is called Jassar.

Source: The India - Pakistan war of 1971 A History
The Pakistani enclave of Jassar encompasses the southern end of the Ravi road-rail bridge,
crucial for integrating Pakistan's communication network with Punjab. It lies close to Dera Baba
Nanak, offering strategic routes to major Punjab towns like Gurdaspur, Batala, Beas, and
Amritsar. A decisive armored advance from this enclave could potentially capture Gurdaspur,
flank defenses of Amritsar and Pathankot, and exert pressure towards Jammu and Kashmir. The
Pak occupation of the town could, therefore, disrupt the Indian defence.
Similarly, the Indian Kasowal enclave provides a significant bridgehead for operations against
Jassar and Narowal defenses. Jassar serves as a pivotal railway station and communication hub
on the Pasrur-Narowal-Shakargarh road. Both enclaves are fortified with defenses to prevent
surprise attacks, including Dhussi and ring bunds used for flood control and defensive barriers.After the preemptive strike by Pakistan on 03 December, India decided to eliminate the Pak
enclave there. As the area was marshy and covered by thick growth of elephant grass, kikar and
shisham trees, the strength and disposition of Pak forces could not be assessed accurately.
However, it was estimated that there were three Ranger Posts in addition to a network of
defences occupied by units of the regular army. At Dera Baba Nanak, where India launched the
operation (OP Akal), the layout of the terrain was as follows:
At the Eastern end of the Dera Baba Nanak bridge, there were four bunds: the Depth Bund, Rail
Bund, Road Bund, and River Bund. Pakistan had positioned one company of soldiers there,
along with their headquarters and heavy guns.
Branching off from the Rail Bund was Dhussi Bund, which stretched eastward towards a ranger
post named Mardana. This area had several fortified positions with concrete defenses, including
a small building known as the Colonel's Hut. The Pakistani commander stationed a company
here, supported by machine guns and recoilless guns.
South of the Dhussi Bund were seven smaller mounds covered in scrub vegetation, known as
the Ring Bunds. The same Pakistani Company defending the Dhussi Bund also protected this
area. Further West, on the opposite bank of the Ravi River, were the Western End and Dry Tree
End. Pakistan had fortified these areas heavily with concrete defenses along the riverbanks and
two embankments near the bridge. They had deployed two Companies of regular army troops
in this area, showing its importance in their defensive strategy.
86 Infantry Brigade under Brigadier Gowri Shankar planned to attack the enemy from the rear
with infantry and armour. The operation involved a long march through an unknown area
covered by sarkanda grass and also crossing of the river. The plan was put into action at 1700
hours on 05 December, when a Company of 4/8 GORKHA RIFLES moved towards the Metla
enclave, and secured it by 1815 hours, despite Pak interference from Gujartur and Mardana.
Simultaneously, 17 RAJPUT and a Brigade Commando Company, captured area ‘7r’ by 1840
hours and then, pressing on towards Colonel's Hut, cleared the area Copse by 2230 hours. They
secured the crossing site for armour and infantry columns on river Ravi, early in the morning.Source: Mrs. Radha Gowrishankar and Ms. Matangi Gowrishankar
Phase I of the attack launched at 1700 hours on 05 December, also included the securing of
FUP, about 180 meters to the North-East of Colonel's Hut and Ring Bund No 7, by 0300 hours
on 6 December. But, 10 DOGRA and 71 Armoured Regiment could not advance swiftly due to
marshy ground and mist and reached crossing site No.1 much behind schedule (2135 hours).
The Dogras found the site inconvenient, and therefore, moved towards ‘7r’ to attempt a
crossing, which they reached by 2345 hours. As it would have taken 10 DOGRA two hours
more to reach the FUP, 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES was ordered to launch Phase II of the attack, to
capture Colonel's Hut and Ring Bund No 6. The Gorkhas launched an attack on Dhussi Bund,
undeterred by incessant firing by the defenders entrenched in concrete pillboxes, bunkers and
trenches. They captured the Colonel's Hut after hand-to-hand fighting by 0230 hours and
cleared ""T' Junction by 0600 hours on 6 December, thus reaching up to the eastern end.
The capture of Colonel's Hut by the Gorkhas went a long way in helping the 10 DOGRA attack
on the Eastern Bund at 0325 hours. The Dogra attack from the rear came as a surprise to the
defenders but they gave a tough fight and at some places had to be silenced by lobbing hand-
grenades into the pillboxes. The Eastern Bund was captured by 0430 hours on 06 December,
with close fire support by 71 Armoured Regiment and 42 Field Regiment. This completed Phase
III, that is the final phase, of the operation. 17 RAJPUT, who had provided the firm base for
the operation, finally cleared the Khokarke and Sandhowan Posts.Brigadier KG Shankar with his Soldiers

The Pakistanis made a counterattack on the night of 06/07 December, but the Indian troops
foiled it with the help of concentrated artillery fire. Another Pak attempt on the night of 07/08
December was also foiled. In desperation the Pakistanis destroyed the first pier of the Dera
Baba Nanak bridge. In this operation, the Pakistanis suffered 34 killed and 26 POWs. Indians
suffered 10 killed, 32 wounded and three missing.
During the battle for the capture of the Eastern end of the bridge, Captain Devinder Singh
Ahlawat displayed great courage in silencing a machine gun nest that was causing heavy
casualties to his troops. With total disregard for his life, he charged the pillbox and threw a
grenade inside it to destroy the gun crew. In this effort he lost his life. For his outstanding
courage he was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, posthumously.Images of the Battlefield

Rattan, in Una District of Himachal Pradesh. He was the eldest son among the four siblings, he
had two younger brothers and one sister. Lieutenant Colonel Rattan pursued his schooling from
Daulatpur Government School. Thereafter, he went to the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun
and was commissioned into the 4th Battalion of the Sikh Regiment on 11 December 1955. After
serving in the unit for six years, he was posted to 6 SIKH Regiment at Meerut Cantonment on
the re-raising of the Unit in 1962.
Lieutenant Colonel Rattan married Mrs Brij Rattan on 14 October 1958, and they had two sons.
He took over the command of the 6 SIKH Regiment on 10 April 1970,
The Sikh Regiment is one of the highest decorated Regiments of the Indian Army. It came into
existence on 01 August 1846, with the raising of Regiment of Ferozepore Sikhs and Ludhiana
Sikhs by Captain G Tebbs and Lieutenant Colonel P Gordon respectively. They participated
effectively in the 1857 First War of Independence. This war proved to be beneficial for the
Sikhs as it revealed their valour and fighting tenacity. They soon earned a rank of seniority over
other Indian Sepoys. Under the British Indian Army, the Sikh Regiment fought gallantly in a
number of war and battles including the Battle of Saragarhi in which they left an indelible mark
in the Regiment’s history. By 1914 the Sikh Regiment was deployed as part of British Indian
Army for operations in World War I. The Regiment served in all theatres of operations and
earned 28 battle honours. The modern Sikh Regiment traces its roots directly from the 11th Sikh
Regiment of the British Indian Army. When transferred to the Indian Army post-Independence,
the numeral 11 was removed and new battalions were added. 1 SIKH was later mechanised in
1970 and re-designated as 4 MECHANISED INFANTRY on 02 April 1979.
India gained Independence in 1947, and the partition resulted in the creation of Pakistan. The

gain impetus for the ground attacks that were to follow. At 0500 hours on the same day, two
Pakistani aircraft flew over Poonch and fired a few rockets at the administrative base of 6 SIKH
causing some damage. Pakistan’s 12 Infantry Division had launched its offensive against 93
Infantry Brigade attacking the Durga, Banwat and Doda defences with the aim to capture
Poonch. Throughout the night of 03 and 04 December, there was heavy shelling by enemy on all
forward picquets.

The Punch Sector was defended by 93 Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brigadier Anant
Natu. Kalai Bridge on the Punch River linked it with the 25 Infantry Division. The Brigade had
divided the Sector into three Sub-Sectors before the commencement of war as follows: (i)
Gulpur area to the West of Betal Nala ii) Banwat area to the East of Betal Nala (iii) Doda area to
the East of Dorungli Nala.
In its overall plan, the Brigade had assigned the responsibility of depending on Gulpur to 1/4
GORKHA RIFLES, of Banwat to 6 SIKH and 8 JAT, and of Doda to 11 JAK Militia.
Subsequently, 13 MAHAR (ex 33 Infantry Brigade) was also brought into Punch in mid-
November 1971. Pakistan had started preparing for an offensive in the Punch Sector in
November 1971 and her troops had been seen building-up in Kahuta area. Heavy vehicular
movement, construction of new tracks, repair of old roads, digging of picquets and increased
movement of troops and loaded mules, all indicated their offensive designs in the Sector. Afterthe outbreak of war on 03 December, they tried to seek a breakthrough in all Sub-Sectors.
However, as the Indians were well prepared, Pakistanis failed in their objective.
The Banwat Sector included a hill complex that dominated the Poonch town. The defence of this
Sector was necessary to protect the town from the East and North-East. Picquets 405, which
covered Tund and Helipad. This Picquets and Picquets 406 and 406A were considered grounds
of tactical importance and 6 SIKH was tasked to defend the area. To the south of 6 SIKH, 8 JAT
was located. It was put under the command of the 93 Infantry Brigade to give depth to the
defences of 6 SIKH. Lieutenant Colonel Kashmiri Lal Rattan was the Commanding Officer of
the 6 SIKH.
Pakistan was well prepared to attack the Indian Brigade from the northeastern side. Chand Tekri
and Munawri Tekri, nicknamed 'Raja' and 'Rani' respectively, were the two vital positions held
by the Pakistanis in the area. On the afternoon of 03 December, 7 POK troops deployed at 'Raja'
and 'Rani' picquets were relieved by regular troops (coy ex-51 Punjab). The same day,
Pakistanis started intensive shelling of the Indian defended area including Helipad and Tund,
leading to disruption of all line communications near the Brigade Signal Exchange.
6 SIKH had anticipated an attack because of the Pakistani build-up and the development of a
road from Kahuta to 'Rani' Picquet. It had, therefore, prepared extra platoon positions outside
the existing minefields to give depth to the defence positions. Overhead shelters had been put up
on the trenches. The mine density on all approaches to platoon and company defended localities
was three. The engineers had constructed a road from Punch to the base of the Brigade
Maintenance Area to facilitate speedy replenishment of ammunition and evacuation of
casualties.
As expected, the Pakistanis launched a determined attack on Helipad and Tund between 0300
and 0600 hours on the night of 03/04 December, with three Battalions (7 POK, 5 FF Rifles and
14 POK). There was fierce hand-to-hand fighting, lasting nearly two hours. Helipad fell to
Pakistani troops at 1030 hours and the remnants of the two defending Platoons withdrew to the
main defences. The Platoons facing Kalas and Kasba approaches, beat back the attack and took
a heavy toll of the Pakistani troops. In view of the mounting threat to the area, two Platoons of 8
JAT were sent to reinforce them. The attackers then tried to isolate the area by establishing a
roadblock between Piquets 405 and 406 at 1500 hours, but their attempt was foiled by heavy
artillery and MMG fire.Lieutenant Colonel Kashmiri Lal Rattan

At 1530 hours on 04 December, the Pakistanis moved a Mountain Battery (3.7-inch Howitzers)
loaded on 40 mules to the Bhai-Bhai area and resumed the offensive on the night of 04/05
December. They managed to disrupt the Indian lines of communication. The attack was,
however, beaten back again by effective shelling and air strikes. Though Pakistanis remained in
occupation of Helipad, they could not advance further in the face of intense MMG and LMG
fire. The gunners did a magnificent job. The Indian artillery, in the battle of Punch comprised
two Mountain Batteries, one Field Battery, two Light Batteries and one Medium Battery.Lieutenant Colonel Kashmiri Lal Rattan

Artillery shelling continued from the Pakistani side and the Pakistanis had orders to capture
Punch by the evening of 10 December, as revealed by Lieutenant Golap Khan, a Bengali officer
of 51 (Pak) Punjab, who crossed over to India on 07 December. But their efforts failed, and
Indian troops cleared the area Northeast of Tund and also the Kasba Spur. In view of the losses,
Pakistanis broke contact with Picquet 405 and also withdrew from Helipad at 0500 hours on 06
December. Helipad was reoccupied at 0900 hours by two Platoons of 6 SIKH. The area was
found covered with splattered blood and scattered ammunition.
The Pakistanis then formed up with two Companies, each on Helipad, Kasba and Kalas
approaches, and tried to occupy the Helipad again at 2235 hours on 07 December. They were
dispersed by heavy artillery fire. Another attempt made by them at 0200 hours on 09 December
was also foiled.Commanding officer with troops after recapture of helipad.

Lieutenant Colonel Rattan organised the defences with professional competence and skill. From
03 December to 06 December 1971, the enemy launched a series of fierce attacks in strength
against his defended area. On each of these occasions, he positioned himself in the most
threatened locality and unmindful of the heavy enemy shelling and small arms fire, moved from
bunker to bunker encouraging and inspiring his men to beat back the enemy attacks inflicting
heavy losses. Throughout this action, Lieutenant Colonel Kashmiri Lal Rattan displayed
conspicuous bravery and exemplary leadership.Commanding Officer with captured Pakistani weapons

Lieutenant Colonel Venugopal was commanding 5/1 Gorkha Rifles in Jessore Sector on the
Eastern Front.
The first Battalion of Gurkha Regiment (now Gorkha Rifles) was raised in 1815 during the
Anglo-Nepalese war. Impressed by the qualities displayed by Gurkhas during the war, the
British started active recruitment of Gurkhas into the British Indian Army. After the partition,
in 1947 six Gurkha Regiments viz, 1 GR, 3 GR, 4 GR, 5 GR, 8 GR and 9 GR remained with
the Indian Army, while 2 GR, 6 GR, 7 GR and 10 GR were transferred to British Army as
part of the Tripartite Agreement signed between India, Nepal and Britain. Post-independence
11 GORKHA RIFLES was re-raised on 01 January 1948. Since independence, the Gorkhas
have proved their mettle in Sino-India War of 1962 where a Gorkha Battalion fought under
the most demanding conditions on the Namka Chu in NEFA (Now Arunachal Pradesh). Later,
the Gorkha Battalions also involved in Indo-Pak War of 1965 and 1971. Their motto is
‘Kafar Hunu Bhanda Marnu Ramro’ (Better to die than live like a coward). In the Sino-India
War of 1962, the regiment was posted in the North-East Frontier Agency Sector (NEFA) and
fought valiantly in the crucial battles in Namka Chu Sector. The Gorkha’s have contributed

4 Mountain Division, under Major General MS Brar, was given the operational responsibility
of the Jhenida-Kushtia Sector, which was bound in the north by the Ganga, and in the south
by the Jibannagar-Kaliganj-Jhenida-Faridpur road. The important north-south highway in this
sector passed from the Hardinge Bridge in the north to Jessore in the south-east, via Kushtia
and Jhenida.
The border area on the Indian side was well linked with a network of roads. While Hardinge
Bridge provided the railway link between the north-western and south-western sectors, the
ferries at Faridpur and Goalundo Ghat located in this area, provided suitable approaches toDhaka. There were two main river obstacles in this Sector, viz., Ganga in the North, and
Garai-Madhumati in the East. The latter had a span of approximately 1,200 feet, and a depth
of 40 feet in December and was not bridged anywhere along its course. Although the border
area from Meherpur to Chaugacha, along the general line Chuadanga-Kotchandpur-
Chaugacha was dotted with bils (marshes) for about 20 km, this Sector was better suited for
tank operations as compared to the 9 Infantry Division area, South of Jessore. Jhenida was the
most important communication centre in this Sector, as it lay at the junction of the Kushtia-
Jessore and Meherpur-Faridpur highways. It was built as a theatre fortress. Kushtia was
another important nodal point, linking up Hardinge Bridge in the Northwest and Faridpur and
Goalundo Ghat ferries in the East with railways. Besides, there were two main lateral roads
running east-west to the main ferries on the Ganga.
4 Mountain Division less one Brigade had been tasked to capture the nodal points at Jhenida
and Magura with a view to securing the ferry sites on the Madhumati River and thereafter,
those on Padma River at Faridpur and Goalundo Ghat. It was to capture Jibannagar by D plus
2, Kotchandpur by plus 4, Kalinganj by D plus 6, Jhenida by D plus 8, and Magura and ferry
sites on the Madhumati River by D plus 11. Subsequently, the Division was either to secure
Faridpur and the main ferry site at Goalundo Ghat, or to carry out mopping up operations in
area Kushtia and Hardinge Bridge. If necessary, it could also be moved to Bogra Sector under
XXXIII Corps for mopping up operations.
One Mountain Brigade, with a Mountain Battery was to act as Corps reserve. Initially, one
Battalion each from this Brigade was to be deployed to guard the Shikarpur-Bheramara and
Meherpur-Kushtia axes, and one Battalion was to be placed under command 9 Infantry
Division for securing the Northern flank of its thrust. The latter Battalion was to revert to its
parent brigade on the capture of Jhingergacha.
4 Mountain Division had secured some Pak BOPs, East of Karimpur before 03 December.
Reacting to this, Pakistanis reinforced their positions covering the approaches to the Hardinge
Bridge. There were two axes available to Major General Brar to reach the ferry sites of
Faridpur and Goalundo Ghat:
Meherpur-Chuadanga-Jhenida-Faridpur.
Jibannagar-Kotchandpur-Kaliganj-Jhenida-Faridpur.
As the latter was shorter of the two, the Divisional Commander decided to launch his main
thrust along this axis. But to advance on this axis, the Darsana BOP had to be neutralised. The
Division Commander, therefore, ordered 41 Mountain Brigade, under Brigadier AHE
Michigan, supported by armour, to reduce Darsana by last light on 04 December. The 41
Mountain Brigade had three Battalions, 5 GUARDS, 9 DOGRA, 5/1 GORKHA RIFLES,
including the allotment of a Troop of PT-76 light amphibious tanks from the 45 Cavalry, and
one of these three Battalions was the 5/1 GORKHA RIFLES—commanded by Lieutenant
Colonel Venugopal.Gorkha Regiment in Darsana

As 62 Mountain Brigade aimed to capture Kotchandpur and push towards the city of Faridpur
and Magura further East, 41 Mountain Brigade poised for the capture the border town of
Darsana in Bangladesh and push towards the city of Jhenida. Brigadier Toni Michigan—
assigned this tough job of drawing first blood to Lieutenant Colonel Venugopal’s Gorkhas.
On 04 December 1971, 5/1 Gorkha Rifles launched an assault on the border town of Darsana,
successfully displacing the well-fortified Pakistani defenders who had strong pillboxes and
interconnected communication trenches. With intelligence from the Mukti Bahini, Lieutenant
Colonel Venugopal meticulously planned the attack and led the charge himself. He
coordinated with the 22 Rajput, and together with his own Battalion, they captured both
Darsana and Akandabaria. Despite the fierce fighting, the newly raised 5/1 Gorkha Rifles
triumphed under Lieutenant Colonel Venugopal's brave leadership, supported significantly by
a small contingent of PT-76 tanks.Indian troops in front of the Darsana railway station

Next, 5/1 Gorkha Rifles captured the town of Uthali, overcoming its concrete pillboxes and
trenches, all strategically planned by Lieutenant Colonel Venugopal. By the night of
December 5, Uthali was firmly under the control of the 5/1 Gorkha Rifles and 41 Mountain
Brigade. After the fall of Darsana, Brigadier Manzoor Ahmed, commanding Pakistan’s 57
Infantry Brigade, anticipated that 4 Mountain Division would advance North to take the
border town of Chuadanga. In preparation, he repositioned his troops from Darsana towards
Chuadanga, planning to abandon Jhenida. However, 4 Mountain Division had actually
decided to move East instead of North.

5 GUARDS of 41 Mountain Brigade positioned themselves along the Chuadanga-Jhenida
road, setting ambushes for Pakistan’s retreating 57 Infantry Brigade. They were supported by
a Squadron of PT-76 tanks from the 45 Cavalry. At dawn on 05 December, Lieutenant
Colonel Venugopal’s 5/1 Gorkha Rifles departed from Uthali, and headed towards Jhenida.
Their first stop was Kotchandpur, about 40 miles on foot, after which they needed to cross the
Chitra River. Despite the biting December cold, the Battalion successfully crossed the river,
reinforced by the 9 DOGRA on 06 December 1971. Together, these two Battalions, with the
backing of a troop of PT-76 tanks, launched their assault on Jhenida.
Disregarding his own safety, Lieutenant Colonel Venugopal led his Battalion during the
assault on Jhenida, overwhelming the Pakistani defenders. The troops from Pakistan’s 57
Infantry Brigade were taken completely by surprise, as they had only anticipated raids along
the Chuadanga-Jhenida road, expecting Chuadanga to be the next target. 5/1 Gorkha Rifles
spearheaded the 41 Mountain Brigade’s attack, breaking the resolve of the Pakistani
defenders and forcing them to retreat. By 0230 hours on 06 December, Jhenida was liberated,
with the Gorkhas receiving a jubilant welcome from the local Bengali population. As the
balance troops of 41 Mountain Brigade arrived, they captured 30 Pakistani vehicles, 500
truckloads of ammunition, the Headquarters of the Pakistani 57 Infantry Brigade, and
important documents from the city.

The Pakistani casualties were reportedly 29 killed. During this battle 5/1 GORKHA RIFLES
earned two Maha Vir Chakras. Lieutenant Colonel C Venugopal was awarded Maha Vir
Chakra for exceptional bravery and leadership during the capture of Darsana, Uthali and
Jhenida. When Brigadier Manzur Ahmed of Pakistan’s 57 Infantry Brigade learnt about the
loss of Darsana, he ordered his troops to fall back on Chuadanga and hold it firmly as its fall
would open the road to Jhenida or Kushtia to Indians. He moved his tactical HQs from
Jhenida to Chuadanga to personally supervise operations around Darsana and Chuadanga.
Lieutenant Colonel Venugopal meticulously planned his Battalion's assaults and displayed
extraordinary courage in the face of danger to secure Jhenida. For his bravery and gallant
action throughout, he was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra. He continued to fight under
Brigadier Michigan's command, advancing to capture the city of Kushtia and crossing the
Hardinge Bridge into Bhermara by 10 December 10/12, 1971. Lieutenant Colonel Chittoor

against well-fortified enemy defences at ‘Uthali’ and ‘Darsana’. The position had a series of
concrete pill-boxes interconnected with elaborate communication trenches. Lieutenant
Colonel Chitoor Venugopal planned the attack with great professional skill. Showing
complete disregard for his personal safety, he led the attack and by his presence inspired his
men to achieve the objective. After the capture of these two position the battalion relentlessly
pursued the withdrawing enemy giving him no rest or time to regroup till ‘Jhenida’ was
captured three days later.
Throughout, Lieutenant Colonel Chitoor Venugopal displayed conspicuous bravery

Engineers, an important combat support arm of the Indian Army. He obtained his Engineering
degree from the College of Military Engineering, Pune, in 1962.
The Corps of Engineers is one of the oldest arms of the Indian Army. The origin of the Corps
dates back to 1780 when the two regular pioneer companies were raised in the Madras
Presidency Army. Subsequently, the Group of Madras, Bengal and Bombay Sappers were
formed in their respective presidencies. These Groups came together when the British Indian
Army was formed after 1857 and were later merged on 18 November 1932 to form the Corps
of Indian Engineers. Engineer Groups initially consisted of field companies (a sub-unit
organization that exists to this day). Till 1911, the Sappers also had the duty of passing
battlefield messages. Between 1911 and 1920, they handed this task to a batch of their own
kinsmen who then formed the Corps of Signals. The Sappers also contributed the first batch
of airmen when the Indian Air Force was raised in 1932. From 1942-1945 officers of the
Indian Railways were recruited into this Corps to participate in Britain’s Burma Campaign.

Source: “Fakhr-E-Hind” The Story of the Poona Horse
On the 03 December 1971, the official outbreak of war with Pakistan saw the deployment of
the 9 Engineer Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel BT Pandit to the Western front. Post-
midnight, three Infantry Brigades of 54 Infantry Division, with the 47 Infantry Brigade at theforefront and supported by the 74 and 91 Infantry Brigades, crossed the border to counter the
Pakistani army's offensive.
The task allotted to 54 Infantry Division included the destruction of Pak 8 (1) Armoured
Brigade and capture of Zafarwal. After capturing Lohara-Laisar, Kalan-Mehlwan-Lagwal it
decided to establish a bridgehead to the south-west of Basantar. The 47 Infantry Brigade was
ordered to establish the bridgehead, in the area Barapind-Sikandarpur-Lalial and south-west
shoulder of the Supwal Ditch, while the 74 Infantry Brigade was ordered to capture the
remaining part of the Supwal Ditch. The Pakistanis had predictably concentrated the bulk of
their armour to the west of the Basantar river in the area of the Supwal Ditch and Zafarwal.
The terrain was devoid of roads and abounded in streams. The Pakistanis had sited obstacle
belts in considerable depth, and had covered them by infantry, RCL guns and tanks. Medium
Machine Guns and infantry 'Nests' supported by automatics were positioned in between the
minefields. The positions were fortified with bunkers, connected by a network of
communication trenches and alternate positions. Gaps in platoon localities and flanks were
covered by elements of recce and support battalions. Formidable mine barriers, approximately
1460 metres deep, were laid.
The tanks from the 16 (Independent) Armored Brigade commanded by Brigadier (later
General) AS Vaidya, MVC needed to support the infantry in operations, and they planned to
advance through Thakurdwara. However, this route was mined with anti-personnel and anti-
tank mines by the enemy. Major Vijay Rattan's 405 Field Company, part of the 9 Engineer
Regiment, was tasked with clearing these mines. This crucial minesweeping operation was
necessary to clear the path for the tanks to enter the Battle of Basantar.
The battle of Basantar was one of the deadliest battles fought on the Western front, and Indian
tanks were needed as soon as possible and as much as possible. For this, Major Rattan ordered
the 405 Field Company’s Sappers to start opening multiple passages through the minefields of
Chakra and Thakurdwara to make way for the tanks. It was a laborious and time-consuming
operation because of the soft going and because the bed of the Basantar had to be hand
breached as the trawls could not operate in the boggy river bed. Apart from that, the depth of
the minefield was not clearly known and there was also some confusion regarding its exact
alignment. The territory filled with mines was over a kilometer wide!
To support Major Rattan's 405 Field Company, the 404 Field Company arrived, but the task at
hand was heavily challenged by relentless Pakistani artillery shelling from 03 December.
From 03 December to 17 December, Major Rattan and his team tirelessly cleared paths
through minefields at Chakra, Thakurdwara, Lohara, and near the Basantar river. This
allowed Centurion tanks to engage Pakistani Patton tanks, resonating across Basantar with
thunderous tank and anti-tank gunfire. Despite being exposed to infantry assaults, Major
Rattan led from the front, overseeing operations under constant enemy fire, moving between
positions to bolster morale and ensure mission success.
In his entire tenure of his responsibility in this heat of battle, he was unmindful of his own
safety. Dacca surrendered on the Eastern front on the 16 December, 1971, but the fighting in
Basantar still raged on. Just a few hours before the ceasefire was declared on the Westernfront at 2000 hours on 17 December, Major Rattan was hit by enemy artillery! Shrapnel
ravaged his body, and he was seriously injured, but his boys evacuated him out for giving him
medical treatment. Unfortunately, he passed away from his grievous injuries.
Major Vijay Rattan Chowdhary—the icon of the Madras Sappers and the 9 Engineer
Regiment, has been awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, posthumously. To honor his bravery, the
Municipal Corporation of Ambala subsequently named one of the main crossroads at the
Ambala Cantonment, Saddar Bazaar after him, now called Vijay Rattan Chowk.
To honour the braveheart, Vijay Rattan Vihar—the Army Welfare Housing Complex in
Sector 15 Gurugram is named after Major Vijay Rattan Chowdhury.

Major Vijay Rattan Chowdhury was incharge of minefield clearance at Chakra on the
Western front. The safe lanes had to be made with great speed to enable our tanks and anti-
tank weapons to reach Chakra which was in imminent danger of a counter-attack by enemy
armour. With utter disregard for his personal safety, Major Chowdhary personally supervised
the operation inspiring and motivating his men to their optimum efficiency. Throughout this
period, the area was subjected to intense artillery, mortar and automatic fire but Major
Chowdhary worked round the clock till the lanes were cleared and tanks and anti-tank
weapons reached onwards. Major Chowdhary displayed exemplary devotion to duty and was
responsible for clearance of minefields of 1000-1500 yards depth at ‘Thakurdwara’ ‘Lohara’
and ‘Basantar River’. While supervising the minefield lane near ‘Basantar river’ nthis gallant
officer was killed due to enemy artillery fire.

The 1971 War was a military conflict between India and Pakistan during the Bangladesh
Liberation War from 03 to 16 December 1971. It began with preemptive airstrikes by the
Pakistan Air Force on Indian targets, leading to India’s involvement in support of Bengali
nationalist forces. Pakistan suffered a significant defeat in this War. The Indo-Pak War of
1971 was the first war when the Indian Government engaged all three services on a large
scale. A total of 4,090 Indian soldiers made the supreme sacrifice during this war and about
600 officers and men of the Indian Armed Forces were decorated with Gallantry awards. Of
these, 04 were Param Vir Chakra, 76 Maha Vir Chakra and 513 Vir Chakra.
The Punjab Sector, which included Punjab, Haryana and the Ganganagar District of Rajasthan
was the responsibility of the XI Corps commanded by Lieutenant General NC Rawlley,
PVSM, AVSM, MC under the overall command of Lieutenant General KP Candeth, PVSM
GOC-in-C, Western Command. The area of responsibility of the XI Corps thus extended over
640 km along the international border. Its Main HQ was at Amritsar from where it controlledthe Northern half of the Sector. The Corps consisted of three independent Sectors. It had
assigned the following defended Sectors to its formations: Amritsar to 15 Infantry Division,
Ferozepur to 7 Infantry Division and Ganga Nagar to Foxtrot Sector now 16 Infantry
Division.
15 Infantry Division under Major General BM Bhattacharjea, MVC was to defend the
Amritsar Sector, including the prominent towns of Amritsar, Dera Baba Nanak and Ajnala. Its
Brigades were deployed as follows:
86 Infantry Brigade in Dera Baba Nanak area.
58 Infantry Brigade in Ajnala area.
96 Infantry Brigade in Fatehpur-Burj area.
54 Infantry Brigade in Atari-Ranian area.
38 Infantry Brigade in Neshta-Rajatal area.
96 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier AE Joseph was given the responsibility of
defending the area between Chann Malla and Bhindi Aulakh in the North-West of Amritsar.
Across the Ravi, Pakistan had a sizeable enclave at Fatehpur and Bhago-Kamo and it could
establish a Bridgehead there and pose a threat to Amritsar. The Indian Army, therefore,
decided to capture the enclave.
On the night of 03/04 December 1971 Pakistan inducted the major part of their 88 Infantry
Brigade belonging to 17 Infantry Division into this Enclave and under pressure from this
force the Border Security Force was forced to vacate Ghoge, Behlol, Gulgarh, Burj and
Fatehpur Posts. The Border Security Force, thus withdrawn, were re-deployed further back at
Vara and the defences there were strengthened by the induction of two Platoons of 15
MARATHA LI and one Troop of 66 Armoured Regiment equipped with Vijayantha tanks
with orders that there would be no further withdrawal.
Orders were then issued to 15 MARATHA LI to attack Tur and Burj and a Troop of tanks
were placed under command for the attack. Before the attack could be launched a Company
of 43 Baluch attacked Bhindi Aulak from Tur. The plan had therefore to be altered: to first
contain the Pakistani attack. The attack was beaten back by Indian Artillery and armour and
the attackers fled leaving behind their dead and some arms and ammunitions.
The attack was finally put in by Major Ranbir Singh, the Second-in-Command of 15
MARATHA LI, with two Companies, on 06 December 1971. The enemy taking shelter in
bunkers bought down heavy fire on the assaulting troops. A close fight ensued. The Marathas
fought their way doggedly from bunker to bunker physically. In many cases the enemy was
dispossessed of his weapons forcibly. The Marathas recaptured Burj and paved the way for
the success of 96 Infantry Brigade.
The Brigade Commander, Brigadier A E Joseph, then decided to put an end to the threat by
capturing Pakistan's Fatehpur Post by using 8 SIKH LI for the purpose.
The plan of 8 SIKH LI, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel H C Pathak, was first to capture
the Dussi Bund up to Fatehpur Post with two Companies by the midnight of 11/12 Decemberand then to push through the third Company To capture Dussi Bund Junction by 0100 hours
on 12 December 1971 and after that to capture an area known as Twin Huts by another Rifle
Company by 0230 hours on 12 December 1971.
On 11 December, Lieutenant Colonel Pathak gave his orders for a night attack tp capture
Fatehpur and regain the lost portion of Dussi Bund. The enemy positions were heavily
defended and fortified, laid out with well-connected trenches and bunkers, mortars and anti-
tank guns that formed a strong line of defense to be broken. Yet, determined to capture his
objective, Lieutenant Colonel Pathak decided to push on with the attack. He himself led the
charge, followed by his Rifle Companies.
The operation commenced with a seven-minute bombardment of the objective after which at
2300 hours on 11 December 1971 'B' and 'C' Companies crossed their start line moving on
either side of the Dussi Bund with the Troops of 66 Armoured Regiment providing support by
direct fire. The enemy Machine-Guns opened up from their bunkers, but 'B' Company under
Major Ravi Kumar silenced them by lobbing grenades into them. Unmindful of enemy
shelling 'B' Company pressed on and captured their first objective. They then moved towards
Fatehpur Post led by their gallant Company Commander and captured the post by 0100 hours
on the 12th after a fierce battle. The enemy counter-attacked but Captain Rajan, the FOO,
brought down such accurate fire on the attacking troops that the counterattack broke up.
C Company made slow progress. Lieutenant Colonel Pathak came forward with his
Intelligence Officer, Second Lieutenant Rai to see for himself what was really amiss. The
Colonel’s presence acted as a further stimulus for the C Company to press on. By 0015
hours, the Company captured its objective. was then pushed through and after some heavy
fighting captured their objective BP 85.

counter-attacked again and again. The attack was finally put in at 0115 hours on 12 December
and 'A' Company, after heavy fighting, captured their objective by 0200 hours. During this
attack Captain Karan Singh who was leading the attack showed exemplary courage and was
killed while leading his troops. The enemy immediately counter-attacked and a fierce battle
ensued.

While directing the artillery fire on the Bund junction, Major Tirath Singh was killed. His
bravery and devotion to duty earned him a Sena Medal posthumously. During this action,
Lieutenant Colonel Pathak moved from one locality to another despite heavy shelling and
small arms fire and encouraged his men to hold their ground and beat back the enemy attack
inflicting heavy casualties. ‘D' Company was then moved up to reinforce 'A' and 'B'
Companies while 'C' Company set about clearing the remaining part of Dussi Bund and the
whole area including Fatehpur post and Twin Huts was secured by the Battalion by 1400
hours on 12 December 1971.
The success of the Battalion was largely due to leadership, good planning and control by
Lieutenant Colonel Pathak - and the excellent coordination between Infantry, Armour and
Artillery and above all the gallantry shown by the men.Throughout the entirety of the battle, Lieutenant Colonel Pathak, the Battalion Commanding
Officer, personally engaged in combat alongside his soldiers, demonstrating exemplary
leadership by leading from the front lines. His courageous conduct led to him being honored
with the Maha Vir Chakra for his gallant leadership. Lieutenant Colonel HC Pathak
subsequently ascended to the rank of Major General before retiring from the Army.
Additionally, he was recognized with the Ati Vishisht Seva Medal for his exceptional service.

IC-23473,Captain,Shankar Shankhapan Walkar,18 MADRAS,"Captain Shankar Shankhapan Walkar was born on 08 March 1943 in Kadgaon Village of
Kolhapur District of Maharashtra. On 15 June 1969, at the age of 26, Captain SS Walkar began
his military career. He was commissioned into 18 MADRAS, which is renowned for its valiant
warriors and many combat awards. Captain SS Walkar was involved in active actions shortly
after he began his service, as the war with Pakistan erupted in 1971. In the Western front of the
1971 war, Captain Walkar's 18 MADRAS unit was stationed in the Nayachor/Umarkot Sector
in Rajasthan and was instrumental in stopping the Pakistani attack during the Battalion’s
advance from Chachro to Umarkot in Sindh Pakistan.
The origin of the MADRAS Regiment in its present form can be traced to the time when the
Levis were organised into companies of 100 men each, and two Battalions were thus raised on
4 December 1758 and placed under the command of Lord Robert Clive to defend Fort St.
George at Madras. Thus, the Madras Regiment is one of the oldest Regiments of the Indian
Infantry. The Regiment recruits its soldiers from the five Southern states – Tamil Nadu, Kerala,
Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka. The valour of the Madras Regiment was seen when
it fought fierce battles during most military operations of independent India. Their regimental
war cry is “Veer madrassi, adi kollu, adi kollu, adi kollu '' meaning “O brave Madrassi, hit
and kill, hit and kill, hit and kill.” In glorious 265 Years of its existence, the Regiment has a
total 45 Battle Honours, 14 Theatre Honours, 11 COAS unit","s, 52 GOC-in-C Unit
Appreciations, 5 UN Force Commander Citations, 01 Ashoka Chakra, 5 Mahavir Chakra, 11
Kirti Chakra, 36 Vir Chakra, 49 Shaurya Chakra, and many other gallantry & distinguished

The 1971 War was a military conflict between India and Pakistan during the Bangladesh
Liberation War between 03 to 16 December, 1971. India gained Independence in 1947, and the
partition resulted in the creation of Pakistan. It began with preemptive airstrikes by the Pakistan
Air Force on Indian targets, leading to India’s involvement in support of Bengali nationalist
forces. Pakistan suffered a significant defeat in this War. The Indo-Pak War of 1971 was the

4090 Indian soldiers made supreme sacrifice during this war and about 600 officers and men of
the Indian Armed Forces were decorated with Gallantry awards. Of these, 04 were Param Vir
Chakra, 76 Maha Vir Chakra and 513 Vir Chakra.
On the night of 04/05 December 1971, the 11 Infantry Division launched a three-pronged
offensive to capture Pakistani territory up to Naya Chor. The axes of thrust were as follows:
 Northern Axis — Mithrau – Mankau – Saidau – Relnor – Kitlor – Jamo.
 Central Axis — Astride the railway line and track running west from Munabao to Naya
Chor.
 Southern Axis — Gadra Road – Gadra City – Pirani ka Par – Dali – Bagal and Kelnor
– Bhame ka Tar – Khimsar.On the Southern axis, 31 Infantry Brigade crossed the International Border at 1830 hours on 04
December. By 1900 hours, 20 RAJPUTS had seized control of Bhame Ka Tar, and by 2305
hours, 18 MADRAS secured Mahadan Ki Dhani. The following day, 05th December, saw the
expulsion of Pakistani forces from several other positions. Despite facing intense mortar fire
and heavy machine gun and light machine gun attacks, 15 KUMAON successfully took over
Gadra City at 0735 hours after an intense hand-to-hand combat that lasted for an hour, resulting
in 40 casualties among the defenders, with many more wounded.
15 KUMAON then advanced towards Dali at 1400 hours and captured Kathe Ka Par by 1800
hours. 20 RAJPUT attacked Khimsar at 1540 hours and secured it by 1800 hours. The Battalion
suffered only two ORs wounded while the Pakistanis suffered one officer and 40 ORs killed.
18 MADRAS then secured Pirani Ka Par by 1300 hours. 15 KUMAON contacted Dali at 1345
hours on 06 December. The engineers made provisions for the maintenance of the Gadra-Dali
track. This facilitated the capture of Dali at 0600 hours on 07 December. The same day at about
0800 hours, 9 MADRAS captured Mahendro Ro Par and Fateh Ro Par. Earlier, a Combat Group
of 10 Para Commando raided Chachro at about 0300 hours with a view to facilitate its capture
by 20 RAJPUT. The Commandos took 17 POWs and captured some weapons and equipment.
The Rajputs cleared Chachro by 1300 hours on 08 December, and thus gained full control of
the Khimsar-Chachro area. Later, they left for Khimsar. Another group of Commandos raided
Virawah at 0200 hours on 08 December. After the capture of Gadra City, Pirani Ka Par,
Mahendro Ro Par, Dali, Khimsar, Bagal and Chachro in rapid succession 31 Infantry Brigade
settled to consolidate the gains.
Maintaining the Division's buildup and supply line on a lone desert track in the region was
proving challenging. Hence, it became imperative to initiate a secondary operation elsewhere
to draw the enemy's attention away from Naya Chor and support the primary offensive.
Consequently, the initial strategy of deploying the 31 Infantry Brigade along the Chachro axis
was modified. A Battalion Group was directed to advance along the Chachro-Umarkot axis
instead. 18 MADRAS was assigned this task and were supported by one Field Battery and one
Light Battery, which commenced its movement at 1400 hours on 13 December.
Several nuisance minefields were cleared by the Battalion, and it moved to Dapaola from Fateh
Ro Par and subsequently to Chachro. At Chachro, orders were received on 14 December to
establish contact with the Pakistani defences at Umarkot by 1200 hours on 15 December.
The distance from Chachro to Umarkot is 80 Km. In 48 hours, 76 Km were covered, and the
vanguard Company clashed with a Pakistani patrol at 1400 hours on 16 December. The
Battalion was ordered to firm in at a place which was just beyond the village of Hingoro Tar.
On the same day one Platoon probed forward, skirted an enemy minefield, and occupied the
Northern end of a sand dune held by the enemy.
Due to the rapid advance, available artillery support was outdistanced except that of one Light
Battery which had managed to reach the Battalion location by last light 16 December with very
limited ammunition.
The Battalion had been without food or water for over 48 hours and had subsisted on one-day's
emergency rations. During night 16/17 December, the Battalion was subjected to intenseartillery and mortar fire. This could not be returned due to limited artillery ammunition available
but the Battalion dug in and suffered no casualties. On 17 December, the enemy put in a strong
attack at dawn preceded and supported by heavy artillery and MMG fire.
Captain Shankar Shankapan Walkar was the Mortar Officer of a Madras Battalion on the
Western front. On 16 December 1971, when the Battalion reached Hingore Tar (Pakistan), after
a march of 42 miles, it came under very heavy shelling from enemy positions. With utter
disregard for his personal safety, Captain Walkar visited each Rifle Company position to tie up
the defensive fire tasks. While doing so, he twice sustained injuries from shell-splinters, but
refused to be evacuated and carried on with his task, in a spirit of outstanding courage and
devotion to duty. Heavy enemy shelling continued during the night, and early next morning the
enemy assaulted two Company positions. Although wounded, Captain Walkar remained at his
job, and by bringing very accurate mortar fire on the enemy, inflicted heavy casualties. At about
0800 hours, the mortar ammunition had almost finished, and the enemy attacked the exposed
mortar position. Captain Walkar inspired his men to hold fast, and by himself shooting down
four of the enemy, forced the enemy to pull back. He was, however, fatally wounded in this
action, and after firing off the last round, he succumbed to his injuries.
For his conspicuous gallantry, inspiring leadership, and exemplary devotion to duty, and for
having fought bravely and laid down his life heroically in the best traditions of the Services,
Captain Shankar Shankhapan Walkar was posthumously awarded the Maha Vir Chakra.

Companies; Phase 2– Capture of 6r and 5r by A and B Companies.
The enemy defences were based on the obstacle, Basantar River, which was reinforced by a
deep minefield on either side, the depth of which was over 1600 yards. Crossing the river was
a relatively simpler task than negotiating the thick minefield which the Pakistanis had laid inseveral layers between the river bank and their positions. But to the credit of 9 Engineer
Regiment the obstacles were speedily surmounted. 1000 yards from the Western bank of the
Basantar river the enemy had his defences covering the minefield effectively with MMGs and
Recoilless gun fire. In the area of the objective of the Battalion, the enemy had more than a
Rifle Company reinforced by elements of recce and support Battalion. The deployment of the
enemy Company was as under: Lalial RF – Platoon plus; Sarajchak – Platoon; 6r – Platoon;
and 5r – Platoon.

The enemy position consisted of bunkers, connected by a network of communication trenches
and alternative positions. Elements of the recce and supporting Battalions were deployed to
cover gaps in Platoon localities and the flanks. In order to cover the minefield effectively,
MMGs and infantry were deployed in between the minefields. Enemy fire was well
coordinated with artillery and OPs positioned in the village. These positions also had mutual
fire support from his location on the Supwal Ditch.The MMG detachment of C Coy

The attack started at 1930 hours on 15 December with C Company on the right under Maj PV
Sahadevan going for Lalial RF and D Company on the left under Maj CBS Krishnia for
Sarajchak. Soon after leaving the FUP, the enemy started engaging own troops with artillery
fire. The MMGs from the enemy nests brought down menacing fire during the crossing of the
Basantar river. During each stage of the battle, he made good use of his alternative positions.
On reaching the far side of the obstacle, the Pakistanis attacked in strength. An early casualty
was the Platoon Commander, Naib Subedar Bhaskaran, who was wounded and disabled. It
was only at this stage that the Company Commander realised that the assessed Pakistani
defences based on Supwal Ditch were extended so much towards the Lalial RF as against the
information available earlier. At least four MMGs including those from the concrete pillboxes
of Supwal Ditch opened up over a frontage of 1000 yards almost halting the progress of the
attack. The Forward Observation Officer was asked to direct artillery fire closer. Under its
cover, the assaulting Platoons kept inching forward just 50 yards behind the artillery barrage.
When within 400 yards of the objective, the enemy fire was so intense and accurate that move
forward was almost stalled.Havildar Thomas Philipose

One of the Pakistani Browning was wreaking havoc, as a result, Havildar Philipose decided to
silence it. Together with Lance Naik Govindan, he crawled and caught the Pakistani by
surprise. The Browning along with its ammunition was captured.

The Platoon was low on ammunitions, and before the supplies could arrive the Pakistanis
counterattacked, at midday on 16 December. Havildar Thomas Philipose, having taken over
the Platoon, thought on his feet and took the decision which proved a turning point in the long
drawn-out battle. Havildar Philipose and his men were only fifteen as against sixty Pakistanis,
in a hand-to-hand fight. He and his men led a brave charge with fixed bayonets against the
enemy. He enthused and inspired this small force. Although, he received a bullet wound
himself, the charge led by him was so determined and brave that the enemy got demoralizedand fled.

2550166 HAVILDAR THOMAS PHILIPOSE
Madras Regiment.
(Effective date of award—15 December, 1971)
Havildar Thomas Philipose was a platoon Havildar in a Battalion of the Madras Regiment
during the battle of Basantar on the night of the 15th/16th December, 1971. During the
assault, his platoon Commander received a bullet wound and could not proceed further
Havildar Thomas Philipose then took over the command of the platoon. Casualties in the
platoon were so heavy that, by the time the objective was captured, the Company strength had
been considerably reduced. At this time, they were counter-attacked by enemy Infantry.
Notwithstanding the depleted strength of his Platoon Havildar Thomas Philipose displayed
conspicuous bravery, devotion to duty and leadership of the highest order; he led a brave
counter charge with fixed bayonets with his meagre strength. He enthused and inspired this
small force. Although he received a severe bullet wound himself, the charge led by him was
so determined and brave that the enemy got demoralised and fled.
Throughout, Havildar Thomas Philipose displayed resolute leadership under adverse
conditions and set a brilliant example of courage and devotion to duty in keeping with the
highest traditions of the Army.

Hissar District of Haryana. His father’s name was Lekhi Ram. Hissar and nearby districts have
been famous for contributing soldiers to Indian Army since Pre-Independence India. Following in
their footsteps, Naik Sheo Chand Ram also enrolled in 120 RAJPUTANA INFANTRY on 23
March 1942. After independence, the battalion was re-designated as 2 RAJPUTANA RIFLES.
During the First Indo Pak war of 1947-48, Naik Sheo Chand Ram was awarded Vir Chakra for
displaying gallantry of high order. He was also granted the Honorary rank of Lieutenant before he
retired from the Army.
The RAJPUTANA RIFLES is the senior most Rifle Regiment of the Indian Army. Its first
battalion was raised in January 1775. The Rajputana Rifles has a long and glorious history. The
Regiment took part in some of the bloodiest battles in many theatres of the world. During World
War II, the battalions of the Regiment fought in every theatre in which the Indian Army was
involved. Three of them, the 1st, 4th and Medium Machine Gun Battalions fought in Eritrea in
North Africa and Italy as part of the famous 4th Indian Division, whose fighting record was one of
the finest in World War II. Post-independence the regiment took part in many battles and
operations including the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Congo. The Rajputana Rifles fought
gallantly in the 1947-48, 1965 and 1971 India Pakistan wars. During the Kargil War, the Rajputana
Rifles displayed exemplary valour and determination, especially in the Tololing Operation. The 2
RAJ RIF was conferred India’s first ‘Instant Unit","’ by General VP Malik, the then Chief
of the Army Staff.
The first Indo-Pak war fought between the independent countries of India and Pakistan began in
1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan were the attempts by Pakistan to annex
the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. On the map of India, the state of Jammu
and Kashmir appeared as a somewhat rectangular projection in the extreme North-West corner of
the sub-continent. In size it was the largest of the Indian ‘Princely States’ during the pre-
independence era. It was 222,870sq km or roughly double the area of Demark, the Netherlands,
Belgium and Luxemburg combined. The state was important because of its strategic location. Even
before the birth of Pakistan, Jammu and Kashmir was surrounded on almost three sides by foreign
states. Today, its importance has been accentuated by recent international developments. To the
East lay Tibet; to its North lies Chinese Turkestan or Sinkiang (Xinjiang); to West is Afghanistan;
to South-West and South was Pakistan; and to the South and South-East lay the states of Punjab
and Himachal Pradesh of India.1 The narrow Wakhan corridor, a narrow strip of territory in

By the end of May 1948, the Poonch Brigade had succeeded in consolidating its position. The
stage was now set up for an operation GULAB for the link up with 19 Infantry Brigade’s advance
from Rajauri to Thana Mandi and Surankot, where the Link up was to be affected with a battalion
of Poonch Brigade from Poonch. A force from Rajauri had cleared the area up to Thana Mandi in
early May and gone back after establishing Birbal post. The commander of 19 Infantry Brigade
planned to carry out the operation in three phases:1. Establishment of a firm base at Thana Mandi
2. Advance on the next day to link up with Punch Column at Surankot
3. Capture of Mendhar
After successful operations in Naushera-Jhangar, 2 RAJ RIF was moved to Rajauri to be part of
Operation GULAB. In this Operation 2 RAJ RIF was given the task of protecting the East flank
of the main force advancing from Rajauri to Thana Mandi. This task entailed capture of and
securing Point 5603 which was known to have been held by the enemy in strength. It was during
his attack, where Naik Sheo Chand Ram displayed bravery and exceptional leadership. He was
Section Commander of the leading section of the attacking company.
On 29 May, the initial attack progressed well, but towards the end the enemy opened up with small
arms, machine guns and mortar fire. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the jawans continued till
it came to a halt due to deadly fire from a machine gun. In order to maintain the momentum of the
attack, Nain Sheo Chand Ram ordered his section to give him covering fire and he, disregarding
his personal safety, crawled forward, approached the machine gun bunker and lobbed a hand
grenade killing its occupants. The advance was resumed and from 25 yards Naik Sheo Chand Ram
assaulted another enemy position killing three and wounding one. He kept on advancing and
chased the enemy 500 yards beyond the objective. This daring act by Naik Ram inspired his
comrades and the entire section charged onto the objective and captured it.2
Naik Sheo Chand Ram demonstrated exceptional, courage, and devotion to duty. He was awarded
Vir Chakra for his gallantry in the face of enemy.

On 21 May 1948, Naik Sheo Chand Ram was the forward section commander during the advance
on feature in Jammu Kashmir when this section came under heavy enemy automatic fire at very
close range. Undaunted, he rallied his men and assaulted the enemy bunkers, killing three and
wounding many and finally clearing the area of all enemy soldiers. Later, during the mopping up
operations on 29 May, Naik Sheo Chand Ram's section advanced under heavy automatic fire. He
captured his objective at the point of bayonet and killed one enemy. Under artillery concentration,
the advance was resumed and from 25 yards Naik Sheo Chand Ram assaulted another enemy
position killing three and wounding one. He kept on advancing and chased the enemy 500 yards
beyond the objective.
The courage, high sense of duty, confidence and magnificent leadership shown by this NCO
enabled his platoon to capture the objective.

nonsense style of speech, deportment and body language mesmerized us. We saw him in
the mould of the great Cavalry heroes of World War 2; Manstein, Guderian; Rommel;
Patton. It helped that he was a Master Gunner; a tactician extraordinaire and was, in all
senses; a Prussian General Staff Officer. We all thought he was special and he was. I had
the privilege as a Squadron Commander, of participating in 1986 in a fascinating series of
perceptively scaled operational discussions, followed by a map and sand-model
discussions, Test Exercises Without Troops (TE'sWT) cumulatively called Brazen Chariots
created by Hanut to bring all ranks of his Strike Corps on one operational-and-logistics
grid for Exercise Brass- Tacks. Hanut had been specially selected by Army Chief, Gen
Sundarji to be the Blue Land Commander for the exercise; then touted to be Asia's largest
operational-cum-strategic level mechanised exercise since World War 2. Brass Tacks itself
was itself scaled to end up in Brass Tacks-4; an exercise that almost went down to the wire,
sending a shiver up Pakistan's spine till certain changes were done in its conduct modalities
and the exercise ended as was perhaps visualized - to bring out some high-level conduct
and conceptual lessons. One major validation that took place was of Hanut's and Sundarji's
conceptual thoughts in handling large mechanised and other forces in free-flowing, multi-
pronged, multi-objective deep thrust operations while retaining tactical cohesion at Unit
and lower levels. In several ways, it was a logical operational level upgrade in “handling
armour” since Hanut's halcyon Shakargarh days. “We rolled with Huntie” is and will
remain for many of us, a life-long, professional and special feeling.”
Lieutenant General Hanut Singh was also known for his efforts to modernize and improve the
Indian Army. He was a strong advocate for the use of technology in the military and made
significant contributions to the development and implementation of new weapons systems and
military equipment.He commanded Poona Horse, 14 (Independent) Armoured Brigade, 17
Mountain Division, 1 Armoured Division and 2 Corps during his career. He served in the
Military Operations Directorate as a Brigadier was Director General Mechanised Forces and
retired as Commandant Armoured Corps Centre and School. Much of what the Mechanised
Forces are today is directly traceable to Hanut and the professional edge he gave them during the
decades he was in service. General Hanut Singh was one of the key contributors to the
warfighting doctrines that shaped the Corps and are in vogue today.
He was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra during the advance in Basantar in the 1971 Indo-Pak War.
After the 1971 war, his Regiment was awarded the title of 'Fakhr-e-Hind' by the Pakistani
soldiers for their valour and bravery. He remained unmarried his whole life and was also known
as the 'Saint Soldier' as he devoted his spare time to spiritual readings and meditation. After
retiring from active service on 31st July 1991, Lieutenant General Hanut Singh moved toDehradun to spend the rest of his life reading books and meditating in Shiv Balyogi Ashram,
Rajpur, Dehra Dun. He passed away during his meditation session on 11 April 2015.

POONA HORSE is an Armoured Regiment of the Indian Army. It was raised on 15 July 1817,
as a result of the Treaty of Poona, concluded on 13 June 1817 between Lord Hasting and Baji
Rao II, the Peshwa. The Honourable Montstuart Elphinstone, who later became the Governor of
Bombay negotiated the Treaty of Poona. It was formed from the 3rd Regiment of Bombay Light
Cavalry, raised at Sirur on 04 May 1820 by Major Peter Delamotte. The Cavalry element of this
Force, which was known as the Poona Auxilliary Horse was later designated as (Prince Albert
Victor’s Own) Poona Horse. It was amalgamated in 1921 as The Poona Horse (17 Queen
Victoria’s Own). In the First World War, the POONA HORSE fought in France, Palestine and
Mesopotamia. During the Second War, the Regiment was part of the British Eight Army. Post-
Independence, the Regiment was part of Operation POLO in Hyderabad in 1948, the India-
Pakistan War of 1965 as part of 1 Armoured Division and in 1971 as part of 16 (Independent)Armoured Brigade. The Regiment was equipped with Centurion tanks in both these wars and
fought in the Shakargarh Bulge. During the 1965 India-Pakistan War, POONA HORSE
displayed immense skill in the Sialkot Sector during the tank battle at Phillora, Wazirwali and
Butur- Dograndi, and the Commandant Lieutenant Colonel AB Tarapore was awarded the Param
Vir Chakra. In the 1971 War the Regiment fought at Basantar and Second Lieutenant Arun
Kheterpal won the Param Vir Chakra and the Commandant Lieutenant Colonel (later Lieutenant
General) Hanut Singh was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra. The Battle of Basantar is considered
one of the fiercest tank battles in Indian military history and the unprecedented bravery shown by
POONA HORSE earned praise from the Pakistan army and the title ‘Fakhr-e-Hind’.3 The
emblem of this Regiment is a ‘hand’ which protects and guides its men, ‘The Hand of God Is
Above All Things’.

The Battle of Basantar also known as the Battle of Shakargarh or Battle of Barapind (December
04–16, 1971) was one of the vital battles fought as part of the Indo-Pak War of 1971 in the
western sector of India. The Indian troops won a hard-fought battle that secured this area in the
Punjab/Jammu sector. The name Battle of Basantar actually encompasses the entire gamut of
battles and skirmishes fought in the Shakargarh sector.4

nations. The Indian I Corps commanded by Lieutenant General KK Singh moved into the sector
to capture the key areas. The 54 Infantry Division and 16 Armoured Brigade moved into this
area. As they advanced they were met by a series of minefields and by stiff Pakistani resistance.
A troop of T-55 Tanks with trawls of the 7th Light Cavalry were attached for trawling with the
16 (Independent) Armoured Brigade at the outbreak of hostilities on 3 December 1971, during
the Indo-Pak war. The entire trawling ahead of the 54 Infantry Division, led by the 16
(Independent) Armoured Brigade was done by this Troop. This allowed the tanks to move ahead
before the all-vehicle safe lane was cleared by the Engineers. Thus, while the Indian Division
was facing resistance as the engineers had not cleared all the mines, C Squadron of Poona Horse
crossed the minefield to secure the bridge head. A fierce tank battle ensued and a Pakistani tank
was taken down. After suffering initial setbacks, the 8th Armoured Brigade of Pakistan was
called in to help the Pakistani resistance in the area. When Pakistani counter attack was
launched, Poona Horse in a famous action thwarted the same destroying ten enemy tanks. This
was the action in which Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal with his two remaining tanks
destroyed several Pakistani tanks before he was killed in action.

As the Commandant, Hanut Singh took the risk of sending the C Squadron to cross 600 metres of
an unbreached minefield without a single casualty. Poona Horse fought like lions destroying
numerous enemy tanks in a single day’s battle. Pakistan’s oldest & proudest Cavalry Regiment
13 LANCERS was decimated & crippled. The Battle of Basantar was without a doubt Lieutenant
General Hanut Singh's finest moment. He took part in one of the bloodiest tank engagements on
the subcontinent while leading his renowned Regiment, Poona Horse. His crucial choice to risk
leading the unit across an unexplored minefield turned out to be the decisive element in the
victory. The Centurions of Poona Horse shocked and defeated Pakistan's 13 LANCERS with
Patton Tanks as they attacked the Indian stronghold at Jarpal.5

India-Pakistan War, 17 HORSE had displayed immense skill in the Sialkot Sector during the
tank battle at Phillora, Wazirwali and Butur–Dograndi, and their Commandant Lieutenant
Colonel AB Tarapore was awarded the Param Vir Chakra. In the 1971 War the regiment
fought at Basantar and Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal won the Param Vir Chakra and the
Commandant Lieutenant Colonel (later Lieutenant General) Hanut Singh was awarded the
Maha Vir Chakra. The Battle of Basantar is considered one of the fiercest tank battles in
Indian military history and the unprecedented bravery showed by 17 HORSE earned praise
from Pakistan army and the title ‘Fakhr-e-Hind’.
The 1971 War was a military conflict between India and Pakistan during the Bangladesh
Liberation War from 03 to 16 December, 1971. India gained Independence in 1947, and the
partition resulted in the creation of Pakistan. It began with preemptive airstrikes by the
Pakistan Air Force on Indian targets, leading to India’s involvement in support of Bengali
nationalist forces. Pakistan suffered a significant defeat in this War. The Indo-Pak War of
1971 was the first war when the Indian Government engaged all three services on a large
scale. A total of 4090 Indian soldiers made supreme sacrifice during this war and about 600
officers and men of the Indian Armed Forces were decorated with Gallantry awards. Of these,
04 were Param Vir Chakra, 76 Maha Vir Chakra and 513 Vir Chakra. In the Battle of
Basantar, the Battalion was awarded two Maha Vir Chakras, five Vir Chakras, two Sena
Medals and five Mention-in-Despatches.
54 Infantry Division earmarked 47 Infantry Brigade with 17 HORSE to establish a
Bridgehead in the Lalian Reserve Forest area across the Basantar River.The plan of 47 Infantry Brigade was as follows:
Phase 1 – 16 MADRAS to capture Sarajchak and Lalial by 2230 hours 25 December.
Phase 2 – 3 GRENADIERS to capture Jarpal on completion of Phase 1.
Phase 3 – Induction of 17 HORSE into the bridgehead.

The task allotted to 54 Infantry Division included the destruction of Pak 8 (1) Armoured
Brigade and capture of Zafarwal. After capturing Lohara-Laisar, Kalan-Mehlwan-Lagwal it
decided to establish a bridgehead to the south-west of Basantar. The 47 Infantry Brigade was
ordered to establish the bridgehead, in the area Barapind-Sikandarpur-Lalial and south-west
shoulder of the Supwal Ditch, while the 74 Infantry Brigade was ordered to capture the
remaining part of the Supwal Ditch. The Pakistanis had predictably concentrated the bulk of
their armour to the west of the Basantar river in the area of the Supwal Ditch and Zafarwal.
The terrain was devoid of roads and abounded in streams. The Pakistanis had sited obstacle
belts in considerable depth, and had covered them by infantry, RCL guns and tanks. Medium
Machine Guns and infantry 'Nests' supported by automatics were positioned in between the
minefields. The positions were fortified with bunkers, connected by a network of
communication trenches and alternate positions. Gaps in platoon localities and flanks were
covered by elements of recce and support battalions. Formidable mine barriers, approximately
1460 metres deep, were laid.The Indian engineers breached the minefield with considerable effort and skill. They also
forged operational tracks in this dusty terrain and surfaced the roadways with elephant grass
and Chari. Other arms too were well integrated. Major VR Chowdhry did a commendable job
in clearing the mines and was killed while clearing a lane. He was decorated with the Maha
Vir Chakra.
54 Infantry Division chose the Sarajchak-Lalial RF-Jarpal-Lohal area for crossing the
Basantar River, while the enemy had expected it around Badwal.
In Phase-l, 16 Madras (47 Infantry Brigade), started the attack on Lalial and Sarajchak at
1930 hours on 15 December. The positions were captured after a sharp hand-to-hand
encounter. The depth positions were also captured by 2330 hours. Both sides suffered heavy
casualties. The Pak Commander could not reconcile to the loss of these positions and made
efforts to eliminate the bridgehead. He launched a series of counterattacks with the 8 (I)
Armoured Brigade and 124 Infantry Brigade, supported by artillery. 16 MADRAS fought
back these attacks continuously for three nights and two days and held its ground. For his
outstanding leadership in this battle Lieutenant Colonel Ved Prakash Ghai was awarded the
Maha Vir Chakra, posthumously.
In Phase-II of the Division attack, 3 GRENADIERS (74 Infantry Brigade) was tasked to
capture Jarpal and Mohal. The Battalion was launched at 2230 hours on 15 December, and in
a fierce battle at Jarpal, most of the Pakistani bunkers were cleared after a hand-to-hand fight.
The Battalion mopped up the remnants still hiding in bunkers and sugarcane fields in Lohal
and captured its objective by dawn on 16 December 1971.
The Pakistanis counterattacked with armour and infantry five times during 16 December but
the Grenadiers, supported by 17 Horse, artillery and mortars, beat off the attacks, inflicting
heavy losses. During the early hours of December 16, after having captured Jarpal, at a heavy
cost in those killed and wounded, Major Hoshiar Singh and his ‘C’ Company of the 3rd
Grenadiers blunted the immediate counter-attack by Pakistan’s 35 Frontier Force battalion
without ceding an inch of the captured territory. Before the enemy regrouped to launch
another counter-attack supported by tanks, the tanks of ‘B’ Squadron less two troops of The
Poona Horse, under the command of Major Amarjit Singh Bal, reached the western flank of
Jarpal (on the eastern flank was Second Lieutenant Khetarpal).
With just eight tanks, Major Bal maneuvered in a manner that the superior armour force of the
enemy was comprehensively held at bay, and also selectively carried out destruction of the
enemy Patton tanks of 13 Lancers ex 8 (Independent) Armoured Brigade — thus not
permitting them to interfere with our infantry operations, while the Grenadiers steadfastly
held the ground beating repeated infantry counter-attacks. During the intense tank versus tank
battle that ensued, Major Bal, for his bold leadership and conspicuous personal gallantry, was
awarded the Maha Vir Chakra. In 2 days, Major Bal’s Squadron had destroyed a sum total of
27 Pakistani Patton tanks.Destroyed patton tank in the battle of basantar

Lieutenant Arun Khetrapal rushed forward with his troop to assist. Despite casualties to his
crew, he fiercely attacked the enemy armour and destroyed four tanks. Meanwhile, his tank
was hit but he refused to abandon it and destroyed one more tank. In the process he received a
second hit and was killed. He was decorated with Param Vir Chakra, posthumously.

The Pakistanis were now desperate. They put in a more determined effort at 0430 hours on 17
December, to dislodge the Grenadiers, charging them in wave after wave. The Grenadiers
fought gallantly and beat back all the attacks. The last counterattack was made by the
Pakistanis at Jarpal.The POONA HORSE squadron

Repeated failures completely demoralised Pakistanis and they stopped the counterattacks at
dusk on 17 December. They lost 89 men, including Lieutenant Colonel Mohammed Akram
Raja, the CO, 35 Frontier Force Rifles. Brigadier Jehangir Karamat of the Pakistan Army has
succinctly described severity of the debacle: ""One cannot, however, help comparing this
attack to the controversial charge of the Light Brigade. The Armoured Brigade lost almost
fifty tanks and failed to restore the defences on the Basantar Nullah. The enemy was not
destroyed; in fact, his losses were less than one third of the Armoured Brigade's losses.""?

Major Amarjit Singh Bal also took part in the Indo-Pak War of 1965. He was the Intelligence
Officer of the Commandant of the Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel AB Tarapore, and had
joined the advance towards the Zafarwal-Sialkot crossroads. Being the Commandant’s
Intelligence Officer, Major Bal shared his tank with Lieutenant Colonel Tarapore. When the
tank was hit, Major Bal was wounded in both the ankles and had to spend eight months in the
Delhi Military Hospital.

The DECCAN HORSE was raised from two old Hyderabad raised regiments the 20th ROYAL
DECCAN HORSE and the 29th LANCERS (Deccan Horse). The Nizam of Hyderabad had been
persuaded to have his Army officered by Britishers and this decision had been popular with the
Army. It was in 1816 that Captain Evans Davies arrived in the State and four Cavalry Regiments
were created which became the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th Regiments Nizam's Cavalry. The 4th was to
be raised in 1826. In 1854. the Cavalry force was reduced to four Regiments and had already
won the approval of Lord Gough, then Commander-in-Chief, India who, in 1853, before a House
of Commons Committee had called the Nizam's Cavalry 'the finest Irregular Cavalry in the
world. Their new designation was to be the 1st to 4th Cavalry, Hyderabad Contingent.The Great Mutiny saw the Contingent on Service in Central India. In 1880, they were
equipped with the lance but the designation was not changed until 1890 when they became the
1st to 4th LANCERS, Hyderabad Contingent. Until 1903, with the incorporation of the
Hyderabad Contingent into the regular Cavalry, the contingents were designated as the 20th
DECCAN HORSE (1st) and the 29th LANCERS (DECCAN HORSE) (2nd). Both the 20th and
29th served in France in the Great War and then and when the Indian Cavalry Corps moved to
Palestine, both Regiments served in the Jordan Valley and in Allenby’s final victorious
campaign. 20TH DECCAN HORSE was titled 'ROYAL' for distinguished service during World
War I. It was the only regiment to be so honoured.
In 1922, following amalgamation of the two Regiments; the ROYAL DECCAN HORSE (9
HORSE) came into being. During World War II, out of the four Regiments that were allocated
tanks, PROBYN’S HORSE and the ROYAL DECCAN HORSE were the Indian Regiments of
251 Indian Tank Brigade.2 During Partition, the Regiment was allotted to India and its name was
finally changed to THE DECCAN HORSE (9 HORSE) in 1950. Since Independence, THE
DECCAN HORSE has fought in the three wars with Pakistan; 1947-48, 1965 and 1971. The
battles fought by the Regiment broke the back of the enemy Armoured and Infantry Division.
The Regiment has blunted and stalled the largest offensives mounted by Pakistan since
Independence. In recognition of its distinguished service; The Deccan Horse was presented the
“Guidon"" by the President of India in 1978.3

During the 1965 Indo-Pak War, then Lieutenant Colonel Vaidya was commanding Deccan
Horse which had been placed under command of 2 (Independent) Armoured Brigade. From 06 to
11 September, the Regiment fought a series of actions in Asal Uttar and Cheema, both in Punjab.
As Commandant, Lieutenant Colonel Arun Vaidya was instrumental to a large extent in
stemming thrusts by Pakistani armour in the battle of Asal Uttar and later at Cheema.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu
and Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our frontiers with
Pakistan have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing,
incursions and intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive
measures. These attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with
commendable bravery and steely resilience, but always with great restrain to not escalate the
conflict. The Indo-Pak war of 1965 was the second war fought between these two bordering
countries. While India was still recovering from the damages of Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan
saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak
in terms of defence preparation. The war initiated on 24 April 1965, when Pakistan Army,
attacked our territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian
territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak
Border Agreement 1960 and international law as per the United Nations Charter. The Pakistani
forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation Gibraltar. The 1965 war
was fought in various sectors among which, CQMH Abdul Hamid fought in Khem Karan Sector
of Punjab. received a Param Vir Chakra posthumously for knocking out multiple enemy Patton
tanks.4
Khem Karan Sector (India) and Kasur (Pakistan), each five km from the border were connected
by a road. Both the towns provide easy access to extensive road networks of their countries. The
4 Sainik Samachar. Colonel Rohan Anand (2015). Vol 62 No 17. Ministry Of Defence Pg no. (7-9)main obstacles between the two sides were the Ichhogil Canal and Rohil Nala. On the Indian side
road Khem Karan- Bhikhiwind leads to Amritsar and road Khem Karan- Patti goes to Harike,
providing access to bridges over the Beas. Both these axes pass through a cluster of villages
which include Asal Uttar.
On 08 September 1965, Pakistan launched its counter offensive by 1 Armoured Division
towards Jandiala Guru, Beas Bridge and Harike. 4 Mountain Division had to occupy a hastily
prepared Division defended Sector in Area Asal Uttar, in the face of this powerful offensive. The
defended Sector had approximately three and a half Battalions of infantry (18 RAJ RIF, 1/9
GORKHA RIFLES less two Companies, 4 GRENADIERS and 9 JAK RIF) along with units of 2
(Independent) Armoured Brigade (3 CAVALRY, 8 CAVALRY less a Squadron and DECCAN
HORSE) and artillery guns deployed in Area Chittikhui-Valtoha. A few minefields were also
laid and some areas were flooded. Fierce battles raged on 08-09 September in which Indian
forces repelled repeated attacks by Pakistani armour and infantry.

Pakistani armour. The bravery of CQMH Abdul Hamid of 4 GRENADIERS and the outstanding
handling of the armour by Brigadier TK Theograj Commander of 2 (Independent) Armoured
Brigade and by Lieutenant Colonel (later Major General) Salim Caleb, Commandant of 3
CAVALRY and Lieutenant Colonel (later General) Arun Vaidya, Commandant of DECCAN
HORSE prevented any enemy ingress and resulted in severe attrition of the attacking forces.
While the Indian Army was busy establishing defences, the armour and artillery were planning
how to stop the Pakistani attack. 9 HORSE, with a Company of 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES, was
deployed to the South-West of Khem Karan to slow the assault and provide cover for the defence
preparation. The tenacious resistance provided by these units significantly slowed Pakistan's
progress. With the same objective, Indian artillery shelled the suspected crossing points over
Rohi Nala and the Ichhogii Canal. Pattons were smashed. By the afternoon of 07 September, the
Pakistani 11 Infantry Division had established a bridgehead across the Rohi Nala and it captured
Khem Karan on 08 September.
On the night of 07/08 September, Pakistan’s 1 Armoured Division began moving to the
bridgehead, and by the next day, it was poised to launch an offensive to capture Harike and the
Beas bridges on the Beas River. The division comprised 4 Patton Regiments and 5 Mechanised
Battalions. One Patton Regiment from 11 Infantry Division was also made available to it. It was
a formidable force by any yardstick. On 08 September, a Pakistani Reconnaissance Group
approached the 4 Mountain Division position through Ballanwala while the 1 Armoured Division
was still building up. The tanks surrounded the Indian-defended areas and sallied up to the gun
area, approaching on a broad front. To halt the enemy assault, one Squadron of 9 HORSE moved
quickly. Pakistan withdrew after losing two Chaffees in the succeeding combat. Meanwhile, the
own troops continued to build defences. The Pakistanis conducted another reconnaissance with a
Regiment of Pattons around 1445 Hours. The 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES position was overrun, but 9
HORSE attacked and forced the Patton Regiment to withdraw.
A strong Pakistani armour attack was expected on the following day. At 0200 Hours on 09
September, Pakistan's 4 Armoured Brigade attacked the 18 RAJPUTANA RIFLES position
(with two Patton Regiments) utilising moonlight and infrared equipment. Even after making a
breakthrough, the Patton’s were unable to get past Indian defences and were forced to withdraw
after sustaining casualties. On 09 September, at 0430 hours, 2 (Independent) Armoured Brigade
came under command of 4 Mountain Division. The deployment of troops in 4 Mountain Division
Sector on the morning of 09 September was as follows: Three and a half Battalions (out of six) with 9 HORSE less Squadron in the Asal Uttar
area, of the Brigade Defended Sector.
 One Squadron 9 HORSE, in between the Brigade-defended Sector and the gun area.
 3 CAVALRY less two Troops between Dibbipura and Chima. One Squadron 8
CAVALRY east of Valtoha to protect the Southern flank.
 8 CAVALRY less two Squadrons deployed in the Warnala area in depth.

The enemy unleased a powerful force to capture the Indian territory to the West of the Beas.
According to their master plan, they were supposed to arrive in Harike by 1430 Hours on
September 8 and at Beas Bridge by sunset the next day. However, this surge was delayed by
twelve hours. On September 10 at 0830 Hours, the 4 (Pakistan) Armoured Brigade attacked the 4
GRENADIERS with a combat group. After navigating a sugarcane field, the Patton line exposed
itself, and the Indian tank gunners retaliated with lethal precision. The 4 (Pakistan) Cavalry then
made an outflanking move in the direction of Mahmudpura-Dibbipura. Indian 3 CAVALRY,
focusing on the defensive area, followed the maneuver. fired on Pakistani tanks from threedirections. In addition, these tanks got stuck in the flooded fields and were sitting ducks for
Indian tanks and recoilless guns.
The Pakistani armour attempted three more attempts but lost tanks in the engagements. As a
result, by dusk, the Pakistani assault had totally stopped. The Pakistan Army's 1 Armoured
Division, which was its pride, limped back to Kasur in the hours of darkness after being
ruthlessly battered. 9 HORSE played a crucial role in delaying the advance of the Pakistani
armour on Asal Uttar-Cheema axis and inflicted heavy casualties on it.5

General Arun Shridhar Vaidya (then Lieutenant Colonel), CO of the Regiment, showed inspiring
leadership and remarkable resourcefulness in organising his unit and fighting against heavy odds
and inflicted severe casualties on the Pakistan Army's Patton tanks. With untiring effort, he
moved from sector to sector with complete disregard for his personal safety, thereby inspiring his
troops by his personal example. He was instrumental to a large extent in stemming thrusts by
enemy armour in the battle of Asal Uttar and later at Cheema and delivered effective blows to
the enemy tanks. He earned his first Maha Vir Chakra for exceptional leadership during this
battle.
5 S N prasad, UP Thapliyal. The India Pakistan War of 1965. (2011) Natraj Publication, New Delhi.On 21 July 1969, he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier and appointed Commander of 167
Mountain Brigade. Under him, the Brigade conducted operations against the Naga hostiles who
were backed by China. Along with the leader, Mowu Angami, most of the hostiles were captured
with their weapons and equipment. Brigadier Vaidya was awarded the Ati Vishisht Seva Medal
on 26 January 1970. On 02 November 1970, he was appointed Commandant of the Armoured
Corps Centre and School at Ahmednagar after which he was selected to raise 16 (Independent)
Armoured Brigade at Pathankot.
Geneal Vaidya earned his Second Maha Vir Chakra during the 1971 Indo-Pak War, then he was
a Brigadier and was Commander of 16 (Independent) Armoured Brigade in the Zafarwal sector
on the Western front.
India gained Independence in 1947, and the partition resulted in the creation of Pakistan. The
foundation of Pakistan was laid by the Muslim League based on the two-nation theory. Pakistan
comprised two wings- East and West Pakistan which were geographically separated by 1600
kms Indian territory. The two wings of Pakistan were culturally and linguistically different and
the diversities between the two wings could not be bridged by an emotional appeal to religion.
Consequently, fissures started erupting in the political body of Pakistan soon after the
Independence and with each passing year it widened. In the absence of appropriate defence
arrangements, the people of East Pakistan felt isolated and abandoned. Finally, the malfeasance
of Pakistani leadership during Cyclone Bhola and the overwhelming support for the Awami
League in the 1970 elections, proved the proverbial last straw on the camel’s back.6 The Awami
League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (of East Pakistan) secured an absolute majority in the
general elections held in December 1970. This entitled the League to form a Government in
Pakistan. However, Pakistan’s military rulers denied this democratic right to the Awami League,
in connivance with the PPP, led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. This arbitrary act of government caused
deep resentment among the population of East Pakistan resulting in widespread protests. When
the slide became unmanageable, the Pakistani rulers resorted to a midnight crackdown on 25
March 1971. The government ordered a military crackdown and the Pakistan army under
Lieutenant General Tikka Khan unleashed a reign of terror and massacred thousands of Bengalis
in a genocide code-named ‘Operation Searchlight’. Pakistan launched its attack against India on
03 December 1971. The Indo-Pak War of 1971 was the first war when the Indian Government
engaged all three services on a large scale.
An important battle of the Western Sector was fought in the Shakargarh area. The Battle of
Basantar was fought from 15 to 17 December turned out to be one of the fiercest tank battles of

Indian Territory as possible, to compensate for the likely losses to be suffered on the Eastern
Front. The objective was to obtain a better bargaining position vis-à-vis India, during the postwar
negotiations. India felt that with this objective, Pakistan could launch an attack opposite the
Shakargarh Bulge targeting Pathankot and the Jammu-Pathankot Road. Brigadier Arun Vaidya
was commanding 16 (Independent) Armoured Brigade, during the Battle of Basantar in the
Shakargarh Sector, where he displayed outstanding leadership and was awarded the, Bar to Maha

The Centurion Tanks’ Brigade under Brigadier A S Vaidya, had on its ORBAT 16 Light
Cavalry, 4 Horse (Hodson’s Horse) commanded by Lieutenant Colonel ( later Lieutenant
General) RM Vohra, 17 Horse (Poona Horse) commanded by Lieutenant Colonel ( later
Lieutenant General) Hanut Singh, 18 Rajputana Rifles (Topas APC) and 90 (Independent)
Reconnaissance Squadron (17 Horse) with AMX-13 tanks. At the onset of war, 16 Light Cavalry
was detached to Infantry Brigades of 26 and 39 Infantry Divisions for protection of the flanks of
the offensive. 4 Horse was tasked to lead the advance of 54 Infantry Division with its Squadrons
leading an Infantry Brigade each with a similar configuration for Squadrons of 17 HORSE.
54 Infantry Division's advance was planned to be between the Basantar and Karir rivers. The
night of 05 – 06 December saw the start of the advance. For Indian tanks and men to reach their
targets, including Barapind—Jarpal, they had to cross at least three minefield lines that Pakistan
army had set up. Brigadier Vaidya was told that he, along with the 9 ENGINEER REGIMENT,
whose Commanding Officer was Lieutenant Colonel (later Lieutenant General) BT Pandit,
would have to take the responsibility for the trawling and clearing operations. The advancing
forces encountered fierce resistance to the East of the Zafarwal—Dhamtal line at Dehira and
Chakra, not only from the mines but also from heavily constructed Infantry positions with
concrete bunkers.
Brigadier Vaidya, who was battle hardened from earlier wars and campaigns since his
commission, personally moved between the two arms of the 54 Infantry Division, encouraging
his men. He moved his Brigade swiftly to get to grips with the Pakistan Army and took the
enemy tanks by surprise. Employing his tanks relentlessly and aggressively, he helped the
division to maintain constant pressure & momentum of advance against the Pakistan Army.

In the battle of Chakra and Dehira, the going was difficult due to deep minefield and terrain. In
a cool and confident manner, Brigadier Vaidya undertook the crossing through the minefield. He
personally moved forward, disregarding personal safety. Through his inspired leadership, the
entire squadron pushed through the lane and quickly deployed itself to meet the enemy's counter-
attacks. During the Battle of Basantar, he again displayed his professional skill and superb
leadership. He got his tanks through one of the deepest minefields, expanded the bridgehead and
repulsed a strong enemy counter-attack. In this battle, 62 enemy tanks were destroyed.
Even though the 1971 Western front for India was primarily a ""holding operation"", General
Vaidya was in the middle of some of the deadliest battlesa that still have lessons for integrated
operations to this day. Throughout the War, General Vaidya displayed outstanding courage,
great professional skill, indomitable will, foresight and imagination in fighting against the enemy
in keeping with the best traditions of the Indian Army earning him his Second Maha Vir Chakra.
On 04 January 1973, Brigadier Vaidya was promoted to the rank of Major General and appointed
General Officer Commanding (GOC) the elite 1 Armoured Division. On 1 April 1974 after
command of the Division he moved to Army Headquarters as Director Military Operations
(DMO). Promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General in January 1980, he held the appointment of
Master General of Ordnance and later as the General Officer Commanding of 4 Corps before
being elevated to the appointment of General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Eastern
Command in June 1981. His tackling of the insurgency problems in his command has been
particularly praiseworthy. He was awarded the Param Vishisht Seva Medal (PVSM) in 1983 for
distinguished service of the most exceptional order.In 1983, General Arun Shridhar Vaidya ascended to the pinnacle of his military career when he
was appointed as the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), the highest-ranking military officer in the
Indian Army. General Vaidya took over as the COAS from 01 August 1983 to 31 January 1985.

During his tenure as Army Chief, he focused on modernizing the armed forces, enhancing
combat readiness, and improving strategic capabilities. Under his visionary leadership, the Indian
Army underwent significant reforms, adopting new technologies, refining doctrines, and
strengthening defense infrastructure. He displayed exceptional vision and led the army with great
determination and integrity. One of the most significant challenges Vaidya faced during his
tenure as Chief of Army Staff was the growing militancy in Punjab. He planned Operation Blue
Star in June, 1984, a military action against militant Khalistan separatists who barricaded
themselves in the Sikh's shrine the Golden Temple in Punjab.General Vaidya during Operation Bluestar

Operation Bluestar aimed to flush out Sikh militants who had taken refuge inside the Golden
Temple complex in Amritsar, Punjab. The operation was carried out in response to the growing
Sikh separatist movement and the escalating militancy in Punjab region. Lieutenant General K
Sundarji assisted General Vaidya in the planning and coordination of Operation Bluestar. Major
General Kuldip Singh Brar GOC 9 Division was responsible for clearing the Golden
Temple.9 The main objective of the Operation Bluestar was to remove Jarnail Singh
Bhindranwale, the leader of the Sikh extremist group ‘Damdami Taksal’, and his armed
followers from the Golden Temple complex. The complex had become a stronghold for militants
who had amassed a large ammunition and weapons and turned it into a fortified position. Under
the command of General Kuldip Singh Brar, the Indian Army launched the operation on 03 June,
1984. The operation involved a significant deployment of troops and heavy artillery, with the
aim of neutralizing the militants while minimizing civilian casualties and damage to the sacred
shrine.

On 31 January 1986 after completing forty years of distinguished service General Vaidya
retired to a quiet life in Pune. The aftermath of Operation Bluestar had witnessed a significant
escalation in Sikh militancy, including the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her
Sikh bodyguards. General Vaidya had been well aware of the potential threats to his life due to
his prominent role in Operation Bluestar. His response was straightforward and soldier like:
""After seeing two wars I can't run away from danger. If a bullet is destined to get me it will come
with my name written on it.""10
Tragically, on 10 August 10, 1986, General Arun Shreedhar Vaidya's life was cut short when he
was assassinated in Pune by Sikh militants of Khalistan Commando Force (KCF), Harjinder
Singh aka Jinda and Sukhdev Singh, aka Sukha. At the time of assassination, he was riding in a
car in the western city of Pune. General Vaidya was driving with his wife seated next to him in
the car. His security officer Baburao Kshirsagar was sitting in the back when the militants fired
three bullets from a close range.11

across the nation. It shed light on the serious challenges and dangers confronted by military
officers engaged in counter-insurgency operations. The nation expressed widespread
condemnation of General Vaidya's assassination, mourning the loss of a highly decorated and
esteemed military leader. General Vaidya's untimely demise was a profound loss to the Indian
Army and the nation as a whole. His assassins, Jinda and Sukha were sentenced to death in 1989
and executed on 09 October, 1992.
General Vaidya was posthumously awarded the Padma Vibhushan - India's second highest
civilian honour - for his tireless service to the nation. Despite his premature departure, General
Vaidya's contributions and legacy endure. As an outstanding military leader, General Vaidya’s
life exemplifies the values of courage, sacrifice, and commitment to the nation, serving as an
inspiration to future generations of military leaders.","Lieutenant Colonel Arunkumar Shridhar Vaidya (IC-1701) The Deccan Horse (9th Horse)
Lieutenant Colonel Arun Shridhar Vaidya was in command of Deccan Horse in the series of

in the operations against Pakistan.
In the battle he showed inspiring leadership and remarkable resourcefulness in organising his
unit and fighting against heavy odds and inflicted severe casualties on the Patton tanks of the
enemy.
With untiring effort, he moved from sector to sector with complete disregard for his personal
safety thereby inspiring his troops by his personal example. He was instrumental to a large extent
in stemming thrusts by enemy armour in the battle of Asal Uttar and later at Cheema and
delivered effective blows to the enemy tanks on 10–11 September.

IC - 4128,Brigadier,Kailash Prasad Pande,The Regiment of Artillery,"Brigadier Kailash Prasad Pandey was born on 04 July 1925 in a family which had a long
history of serving in the military. He was born in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. During his
graduation years at Gwalior’s Victoria College, former Prime Minister of India Mr. Atal Behari
Vajpayee was his class fellow. His family had a tradition of its male members joining the Army
and he was to follow suit. He was commissioned in 1945 into the Royal Indian Artillery and
posted to 42 Field Regiment. Throughout his Military career there have been several
accomplishments. He became an Instructor in Gunnery (IG) after qualifying on the Long
Gunnery Staff Course and later graduated from the Defense Services Staff College Wellington.
Having been a Field gunner to begin with, he later became a Mountain Gunner and a diehard one
at that. In 1961, he raised 145 Mountain Battery at Bareilly.
He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1964 and was asked to raise 56 Mountain
Composite Regiment (pack). The Famed 4 Hazara Mountain Battery (Frontier Force) and his
own erstwhile 145 Mountain Battery joined the Regiment later in the same year. After a very
successful command of the Regiment, in 1966, he was posted to the Indian Military Academy
Dehradun as a Battalion Commander. He was flamboyant and full of verve with a tough exterior
(a put on for dramatic effect, because he had gem of a heart otherwise). He was full of the
Gunner spirit and enthused many outstanding Gentlemen Cadets (GCs) to join the Regiment of
Artillery. He was popularly Known by as Tom Pandey, probably because of his josh and short
stature. In 1970 he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier and posted as Commander 2 Artillery
Brigade on India's North East border with Tiber and Burma (now Myanmar). His reputation as a
professional soldier and a dynamic leader had preceded him. He commanded the Artillery
Brigade for a year plus and ensured that the training was hard, realistic and enjoyable. In 1971
when the trouble erupted in East Pakistan with millions of refugees pouring into India, the 1971
Indo-Pak War was forced upon us by Pakistan.
India gained Independence in 1947, and the partition resulted in the creation of Pakistan. The
foundation of Pakistan was laid by the Muslim League based on the two-nation theory. Pakistan
comprised two Wings- East and West Pakistan which were geographically separated by 1600
kms Indian territory. The two Wings of Pakistan were culturally and linguistically different and
the diversities between the two Wings could not be bridged by an emotional appeal to religion.
Consequently, fissures started erupting in the political body of Pakistan soon after the
Independence and with each passing year it widened. In the absence of appropriate defense
arrangements, the people of East Pakistan felt isolated and abandoned. Finally, the malfeasance
of Pakistani leadership during Cyclone Bhola and the overwhelming support for the AwamiLeague in the 1970 elections, proved the proverbial last straw on the camel’s back.1 The Awami
League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (of East Pakistan) secured an absolute majority in the
general elections held in December 1970. This entitled the League to form a Government in
Pakistan. However, Pakistan’s military rulers denied this democratic right to the Awami League,
in connivance with the PPP, led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. This arbitrary act of government caused
deep resentment among the population of East Pakistan resulting in widespread protests. When
the slide became unmanageable, the Pakistani rulers resorted to a midnight crackdown on 25
March 1971. Government ordered a military crackdown and the Pakistan army under Lieutenant
General Tikka Khan unleashed a reign of terror and massacred thousands of Bengalis in a
genocide code-named ‘Operation Searchlight’. Pakistan launched its attack against India on 03
December 1971. The Indo-Pak War of 1971 was the first war when the Indian Government
engaged all three services on a large scale. India unfolded its plan of attack in East Pakistan
following pre-emptive air strikes from Pakistan on 03 December 1971.

The Indian Army began preparing for the war meticulously. Mukti Bahini trained and supported
by India now began skirmishing with the Pakistani Forces all along the India - East Pakistan
border, gradually escalating to a level when regular Indian units and formations were drawn into
the conflict to assist the Mukti Bahini. One such operation was the capture of Dhalai post by 61
Mountain Brigade being commanded by Brigadier Shiv Yadav. The operation was set to begin
1 The India-Pakistan War of 1971: A History. S.N Prasad and U.P. Thapliyal. (2014). Natraj Publishers and Ministry of
Defence, Indiaon 28 October 1971. Brigadier Pande had been directed earlier in the month of July to move to
this area with selected staff to function as the Artillery Adviser. Captain Deepak Kapoor who
would later rise to become the COAS was then his GSO-3 and later became his son-in-law was
part of his group. The Battle turned out to be fierce with many casualties on our side which
included Brigadier Yadav who had to be evacuated. The Corps Commander, Lieutenant General
Sagat Singh arrived on the scene of battle and ordered Brigadier Tom Pande to take command of
the Brigade and carry on with the attack. It was a hard-fought battle where Brig Pande led from
the front with innovation and guile. The Corps Commander was extremely pleased with the
performance, especially Brig Pande's leadership and immediately recommended him for MVC.
Not only that, General Sagat Singh now directed him to take over the Brigade formally. It was a
rare honour for an Artillery Brigade Commander to be given such a prestigious assignment in the
middle of a battle. Brigadier Kailash Prasad Pande lived up to the trust and confidence reposed in
him by his superior, he went on to achieve many more spectacular victories with 61 Mountain
Brigade at Chandina on 07 December, Daudkhandi on 09 December and Mynawati on 16
December, at par with some of the higher formations operating alongside. On 16 December
Bigadier Atif, the Garrison Commander at Mynawati surrendered to Brigadier Kailash Prasad
Pande along with five thousand troops. It is believed that during the course of the war, he was
thrice recommended for Maha Vir Chakra. And for his commendable display of conspicuous
courage and exemplary leadership during the Indo-Pak War of 1971, he was awarded Maha Vir
Chakra.
After the liberation of Bangladesh, the Indian Army was promptly withdrawn from there. 61
Mountain Brigade, now upgraded to a Brigade Group was however asked to stay on and was
placed at the disposal of the Bangladesh government for pacifying restive areas in the East. For
six months the Brigade Group helped put down uprisings and rebellions in the Hill Tracts of
Chittagong, suffering casualties but delivered the goods and as an aphorism came to be referred
to as the Phantom Brigade.
Brigadier Pande took premature retirement and went and settled down in Bhopal, the capital of
Madhya Pradesh, his home state. Madhya Pradesh government was only too glad to welcome the
war hero and wasted little time in utilizing his services. Brigadier Pande was made Director
General of the Home Guards and also got involved in looking after the welfare of Ex-
Servicemen. In 1984 when the Bhopal Gas Tragedy occurred, Brigadier Pande was given charge
of the Red Cross Organization. He did his best to provide relief and succor to the victims to the
maximum extent possible. Later, Brigadier Pande was sent to Sri Lanka during Indian Army’s
Operation Pawan in Sri Lanka.Brigadier Kailash Pande passed away on 04 February 2010, while attending the Artillery
Reunion, at Deolali. His son-in-law, General Deepak Kapoor the then COAS (Fifth of the five
Gunner Chiefs) was there. It was a proud day for the family that turned tragic and poignant.
There was a large gathering of the veterans and senior serving gunners who had gathered at the
Nasik Road crematorium to pay their last respects to a truly great personality from the Indian
Army.","Brigadier Kailash Prasad Pande (IC-4128) 61 Mountain Brigade
(Effective date of Award: 6th December, 1971)
Brigadier K.P. Pande's mountain brigade was assigned the task of clearing a well-fortified
position in the Eastern Sector in December 1971. The task was successfully completed mainly
due to Brigadier Pande's inspiring leadership. He was always well forward, unmindful of his
safety, encouraging troops and directing the battle. The brigade group advanced forty miles in 72
hours, effectively bottling up the enemy and capturing key posts. When lodgment was attained in
the fortress of Mynamati defences, the brigade was subjected to determined enemy attacks
supported by tanks. Against all the relentless pressure of the enemy, the brigade held on to the
defence until surrender by the enemy commander.
Throughout the operations, Brigadier K.P Pande displayed gallantry, leadership and devotion to
duty of a very high order.

in St. John’s School, Meerut and Meerut College, Meerut with Bachelors in Sciences. He was
commissioned into the Indian Army on 23 March 1975 into the 3/4 GORKHA RIFLES. He was
posted to the Indian Military Academy as a Company Commander in 1990. Later, he married
and settled in Delhi. His younger brother is also a decorated officer and was awarded the Sena
Medal.
The 4 GORKHA RIFLES was raised in 1857 as part of British Indian Army but after
independence in 1947 it was one of the six Gurkha Regiments transferred to Indian Army. The
battle cry of the 4th GORKHA RIFLES is- Kafar Hunu Bhanda Marnu Ramro. The 3/4
GORKHA RIFLES (3/4 GR) was raised in the Leslie Lines, Bakloh, on 1 October 1940. The
nucleus of the new battalion was formed by drafts of 3 officers and 200 men each from the 1st
and 2nd Battalions. The remainder of the battalion was formed from recruits and 'recruit boys'. In
March 1944 the battalion was called to provide nucleus for the raising of the 4th Battalion. On
16 June the battalion was ordered to form part of 111 Independent Brigade, under Brigadier Joe
Lentaigne, as part of the Chindit, which was being concentrated in the area of Saugor for
training. The 4 GORKHA RIFLES has an enviable war record. It remains one of the most
decorated units in the Indian army.
The Siachen glacier is the second longest glacier in the world. The scroll of honour at Indian
Army’s Siachen base camp reads, “Quartered in snow, silent to remain. When the bugle calls,
they shall rise and march again.”1 Beneath the veneer of this bleak beauty lie menacing hazards
that snatch away human lives if one is not careful. Given the vivacity of this glacier, it provided a
strategic importance to India, Pakistan and China as it served as a hub for Shaksham Valley and
Karakoram Pass.2 Siachen area has been a bone of contention between Pakistan and India for
many years. The root cause of the issue can be traced back to the Karachi Agreement of 1949.

would be interested in contesting an area where not a blade of grass grows nor even breathing is

complicated the issue. They illegally ceded some 5180 square kilometers of Indian Territory to
China in the area where the boundaries of India, Pakistan and China meet thereby altering the
geo-strategic importance of this area. Secondly, by permitting and assisting foreign
mountaineering and scientific expeditions in the area it raised the issue of ‘rights’ in an area that
did not belong to them. The cartographic ambiguities of 1962 and Pakistan’s growing devious

Operation Meghdoot was the codename for the Indian Armed Forces' operation to seize control
of the Siachen Glacier in the then state of Jammu and Kashmir (now in Ladakh), precipitating
the Siachen conflict. Executed in the morning of 13 April 1984 in the highest battlefield in the
world, Meghdoot was the first military offensive of its kind. The operation preempted Pakistan's
impending Operation Ababeel (which was intended to achieve the same objective as Meghdoot)
and was a success, resulting in Indian forces gaining control of the Siachen Glacier in its
entirety.34

https://indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmTempSimple.aspx?MnId=0gmQNtAjBJivMiPVgCWpSA==&ParentID=Currently, the Indian Army remains the first and only Army in the world to have taken tanks and
other heavy ordnance up to such an altitude (well over 5,000 m or 16,000 ft.). Up to ten infantry
battalions each of the Indian Army and Pakistan Army are actively deployed at high altitudes of
up to 6,400 metres (21,000 ft.) throughout the region of the glacier.
Over the period 20–24 September 1987, during Operation Meghdoot in Saichen, 3/4 GORKHA
RIFLES, while relieving 8 J&K LIGHT INFANTRY in Bialafondla, at heights of nearly 20,000
feet (6,100 m), participated in the defence of Bialafondla beating back repeated Pakistan Army
attacks, which ended on 24 September morning in failure and retreat. In the battle of Bialafondla,
from 20 to 24 September, the 3/4 GORKHA RIFLES lost 13 soldiers and 23 were wounded. The
defenders for their courage, steadfastness, and resolution against heavy odds, were awarded 3
Maha Vir Chakra (MVC), 5 Vir Chakras (VrC), 2 Sena Medals (SM), 1 Chief of Army Staff's
Commendation card, and 3 Army Commanders Commendation Cards. MVC, India's second
highest award for valour, was awarded to Major Krishna Gopal Chatterjee, Havildar Nar
Bahadur Ale (Posthumous), and Naik Prem Bahadur Gurung (Posthumous). MVC, equivalent to
Military Cross, was awarded to Second Lieutenant AK Sharma, AOC, Second in Command
Charlie Company, Naib Subedar Bhim Bahadur Thapa, Platoon Commander, C Company, Lance
Naik Hira Bahadur Thapa (Posthumous), Medium Machine Gun (MMG) Detachment
commander, Rifleman Sanjeev Gurung (Posthumous), and Naik Hom Bahadur Thapa, MMG
Detachment Commander.
Major Chatterjee belonged to the 3rd BATTALION OF 4th GORKHA RIFLES. The battalion
was deployed in Siachen in September 1987. He was commanding a Company which was to take
over the defences of Bialafondla Complex, which included the three forward Posts called Saddle,
""U"" Cut and Ashoka. While taking over the charge of the complex, his Company was subjected
to heavy firing by enemy on the morning of 21 September 1987.5
From the pattern of enemy shelling, Chatterjee deduced that the main target of the enemy was
Ashoka Post. He therefore, decided to stay on at Ashoka Post to supervise and direct the
defences personally. The expected attack on the Post came on the night of 23 September with
heavy shelling. Major Chatterjee directed artillery fire on enemy concentration opposite the
Ashok Post and broke the enemy assault.

September. The defenders however fought with determination and foiled all attempts.
While directing these decisive battles, Major Chatterjee was severely wounded in the left arm by
shrapnel from an artillery shell. But he refused to be evacuated and continued to lead and
motivate his men to hold on the post. However, the enemy was not in a mood to accept defeat.
They re-appeared on night of 24th sept to launch a major attack on Ashok Post with battalion
strength.6
A severely wounded Major Chatterjee again motivated his men to repulse the attack. Two more
determined attacks launched by the enemy on the night were also repulsed. Throughout the
operation, Major Chatterjee motivated and guided his men against heavy odds. He beat back a
determined enemy in hazardous glaciated terrain and adverse climatic condition, successfully.7
Later Colonel Chatterjee writes in a Newsletter in 1988,
“Bilafond La was the scene of one of the fiercest engagements in the ongoing struggle for
the control of the Siachen Glacier. Men of my Battalion, whose predecessors were the
veterans of the Chindit Operations, covered themselves with glory while fighting at dizzy
heights on the highest battle field in the world. This defensive battle fought from 23 to 25
September ’87 will remain an example of personal courage, valour, determination and
sacrifice of our brave troops.”
He was awarded Mahavir Chakra for his outstanding leadership, professional competence,
meticulous planning and bravery.8

shelling of the Bialafondla Complex on 21 September 1987. On the night of 23 September 1987,
his post was subjected to shelling. Throughout the night, the enemy launched a series of assaults,
which were successfully repulsed. Though injured in the left arm by a splinter of an artillery

District of Nepal. The son of Shri Karna Bahadur Gurung, Naik Prem Bahadur joined the
Indian Army on 22 November 1976 at the age of twenty. He was enrolled into 3/4 GORKHA
RIFLES, an Infantry Regiment known for its gallant soldiers with a long history of numerous
battle exploits. After serving for some time, he got married to Ms Maya Devi and the couple
had two daughters, Kalpana Devi & Lakshmi Devi and a son Mekh Bahadur. By 1987, he
had put in around ten years of service and had been promoted to the rank of Naik. By then he
had served in various field areas and gained the field-craft skills required to be a battle-ready
soldier.
In the year 1987, Pakistan made repeated attempts to capture the key some Key Posts in
Siachen Glacier Complex. Naik Prem Bahadur Gurung’s unit was deployed in Siachen
Glacier as part of Operation Meghdoot. He was posted at a vital Post at an altitude of 20,000
feet at the Bilafondla Complex where he volunteered to be a part of the mission to safeguard
India from enemy intervention as a part of Op MEGHDOOT.

the Anglo-Nepalese war. Impressed by the qualities displayed by Gurkhas during the war, the
British started active recruitment of Gurkhas into the British Indian army. After the partition,
in 1947 six Gurkha regiments viz, 1 GR, 3 GR, 4 GR, 5 GR, 8 GR and 9 GR remained with
the Indian Army, while 2 GR, 6 GR, 7 GR and 10 GR were transferred to British Army as
part of the Tripartite Agreement signed between India, Nepal and Britain. The 4 GORKHA
RIFLES was raised in 1817. It was formerly known as the Fourth Prince of Wales’s Own
Gurkha Regiment. Before the reorganisation in 1857, it was known as the Extra Goorkha
Regiment and following the reorganisation it was named as the 19th Regiment of the Bengal
Native Infantry. In 1950, after India gained its republic status, it was renamed to be the 4
GORKHA RIFLES REGIMENT of the Indian Army. The Regiment fought in Europe during
World War I and Middle East, North Africa and Italy during World War II. Since
independence, the regiment has proved its mettle three Indo-Pak Wars of 1947-48, 1965 and
in 1971 and has been awarded battle and theatre honours for all three conflicts. 3/4 GORKHA
RIFLES battalion fought a fine action at Bilafond La, at heights of nearly 20,000 feet (6,100
m) in 1987. The 1st Battalion (JETHI) was awarded the COAS Unit","in 2002, for its
performance in counter terrorism operations in Kupwara district, Kashmir. The Battalion was
commended for neutralizing 94 Foreign Terrorists, in a number of operations in Tangdhar,
Panzgam and Lolab. The Regiment’s motto is ‘Kafar Hunu Bhanda Marnu Ramro’
(Better to die than live like a coward).
Operation MEGHDOOT is an ongoing operation along North-Western Border region of India
in high altitude area of Siachen Glacier, ranging above 21000 feet. Launched on 13 April
1984, this unique military operation was the first assault launched in the world's highest
battlefield. The military action resulted in Indian troops gaining control of the strategically
located Siachen Glacier. It is considered as a feat unparalleled in the history of high-altitude
warfare where soldiers of Indian Army and Air Force operate under most adverse weather
conditions with sub-zero temperatures of minus 50C.1
The Siachen Glacier is the second longest glacier in the world. The scroll of honour at
Indian Army’s Siachen Base Camp reads, “Quartered in snow, silent to remain. When the
bugle calls, they shall rise and march again.”2 Beneath the veneer of this bleak beauty lie
menacing hazards that snatch away human lives if one is not careful. Given the significance
of this Glacier, it provided a strategic importance to India, Pakistan and China as it served as

Walkthrough The Life of Indian Army in Siachen
(Source: https://defencedirecteducation.com/2022/07/13/siachen-glacier-indian-army/)
Siachen area has been a bone of contention between Pakistan and India for many years. The
root cause of the issue can be traced back to the Karachi Agreement of 1949. The
representatives of both the nations drew the ‘Ceasefire Line’ across maps of Jammu and
Kashmir from Manawar in the South, to Khor in the North and thence ‘North to the Glaciers’
through NJ 9842. Presumably when the discussion came up on the glaciated wilderness of
snow and ice the representatives stopped at grid Point NJ 9842 on the presumption that
neither side would be interested in contesting an area where not a blade of grass grows and
even breathing is a problem. The problem started when Pakistan decided to further their
ambitions which complicated the issue. They illegally ceded some 5180 square kilometers of
Indian territory to China in the area where the boundaries of India, Pakistan and China meet
thereby altering the geo-strategic importance of this area. Secondly, by permitting and
assisting foreign mountaineering and scientific expeditions in the area it raised the issue of
‘rights’ in an area that did not belong to them. The cartographic ambiguities of 1962 and
Pakistan’s growing devious nature had concerned the Indian Army. In mid-seventies reports
of foreign mountaineering expeditions crossing the Saltoro Ridge and Siachen Glacier from
3 What is the Strategic importance of Siachen from the Indian point of view. IDSA. (Accessed on 06 February 2023)Pakistan side came to India’s notice. It was also learnt that Pakistan Army officers
accompanied these expeditions. As a result of these reports to establish our own claim to the
area a mountaineering expedition led by one of the Indian Army’s leading mountaineers,
Colonel Narinder (Bull) Kumar, was sent to area in 1978. The expedition went to Tersam
Kangri and in 1984 the Indian Army took pre-emptive action and occupied Saltoro Range.
In April 1984 Operation Meghdoot: Indian Army under the leadership of Lieutenant General
Manohar Lal Chibber, and Lieutenant General PN Hoon and Major General Shiv Sharma,
learned of the plan by Pakistan Army to seize Sia La, and Bilafond La, on the glacier. Indian
Army launched an operation to pre-empt the seizure of the passes by the Pakistan Army.

The task of establishing Indian Army’s presence over Siachen Glacier was entrusted to 26
Sector commanded by Brigadier VN Channa. 4 KUMAON, supported by a Company of
Ladakh Scouts and two Companies of 19 KUMAON commanded by Lieutenant Colonel (
later Brigadier) DK Khanna were in turn tasked to occupy the Siachen Glacier Complex .
Before undertaking the task, the Company Group carried out rigorous training for several
weeks, which included ice craft, snow craft, survival on snow and physical fitness and mental
robustness. The operation 'Meghdoot' was led by Major (later Colonel) RS Sandhu, VrC. The
next wave under Captain (later Lieutenant General) Sanjay Kulkarni, landed on the Glacier,
and hoisted the Indian Tricolour on Bilafond La (Siachen Glacier). The foot column led by
Captain (later Lieutenant Colonel) PV Yadav, SM, reached the Glacier subsequently, after an
extremely strenuous four-day march over extremely inhospitable terrain. The column set up
Camps I, II and III for maintenance of newly established Posts on the Glacier. Companies of
Kumaon Battalion were given responsibility for the security of the line of communication ofthese Posts.4 Op MEGHDOOT was executed in the morning of 13 April 1984 and pre-
empted Pakistan’s impending Operation Ababeel. Indian soldiers managed to control all
major mountain passes of Sia La, Bilafond La and by 1987 Gyong La and all the
commanding heights of the Saltoro Ridge west of the Siachen Glacier.5

In 1987, Pakistan ordered their own troops to establish a Post in Bilafond La in the Indian
territory which was named as Quaid Post after Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. In
order to take control of the Post, India launched an operation codenamed Operation RAJIV to
capture the peak. The operation was named after Second Lieutenant Rajiv Pandey who led a
team of soldiers tasked to capture a feature called Left Shoulder at 21000 feet lying between
two Indian Posts. During the final assault on 29 May 1987, he was killed.6 Quaid Post was
located on a massive ice mass located at an altitude of 21,153 feet above sea level. The steep
ice-wall of Quaid Post gives it a very dominating position and to defend it one has to just take
potshots at anyone trying to crawl up. Naib Subedar Bana Singh of 8 JAK LI volunteered to
be a member of a task force constituted in June 1987. He was joined by four others in this

In the same year, in the month of September 1987 the Bilafondla Complex a vital Post in the
Siachen Glacier region situated at the height of 20,000 Feet was attacked by the adversary
and had suffered heavy casualties in an attack on 18 September 1987. Naik Prem Bahadur
Gurung of 3/4 GORKHA RIFLES was posted at Siachen Glacier area, where his Company
occupied defences at Bilafondla Complex. On the night of 23/23 September 1987, enemy
troops launched determined attacks on his Post but were repulsed. Again, on the night of
24/25 September 1987, enemy troops launched a massive attack on the Post with heavy
artillery. During the action, the Commander was hit and Naik Prem Bahadur Gurung took
over as Section Commander. As the battle raged, his Section was running out of ammunition.
Undeterred, he ran to his Platoon Headquarters twice under intense fire to replenish the
Section with ammunition. His section ultimately beat back a series of enemy attacks.On 24 September 1987, at about 0325 hours, enemy troops launched yet another attack.
When the troops were just 50 yards from the Post, he got out of his trench and charged them,
throwing grenades and firing with his rifle. At this gallant charge, the adversary's troops took
to their heels. Having exhausted his ammunition, Naik Gurung threw away his rifles,
unbuckled his Khukri and ran after them hacking three of the four fleeing soldiers. But during
the hand-to-hand fight, he was shot in the chest and later died. Naik Prem Bahadur Gurung
displayed conspicuous bravery in the face of the enemy's troops and died fighting for his

27 January 1964 and completed his school education from Modern School New Delhi. A young
charismatic man and an athlete, Major Wangchuk participated in cross country marathon before
joining the army. While he was in the second year of his graduation at Sri Venkateswara College,
he decided to join the Army. He was commissioned into the Indian Army on 4 September 1987
into the Assam Regiment. Later, he was deputed to the Ladakh Scouts.
The Ladakh Scouts known as the “Snow Warriors” were initially raised as a paramilitary force
formed of the Ladakhi locals known as Nubra Guards to save Ladakh from intruders in 1948. It
comprised of Ladakhi locals who are physically fit and attuned with the rugged terrain and
hostile climate. The Ladakh Scouts was raised in 1963, following the Indo China War of 1962. It
had two wings- the Karakoram Wing, defending the eastern front facing China and the Indus
Wing facing Pakistan. The regiment currently consists of 5 battalions. The Ladakh Scouts had
fought in the 1965 and 1971 India Pakistan War and were also part of Operation Meghdoot in
1984. Ladakh Scouts was converted into a regiment in the year 2000. The Ladakh Scouts played
a significant role during the Kargil War of 1999 by marking one of the earliest victories and also
received the Unit","from General VP Malik, the then Chief of Army Staff.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu
and Kashmir by any means. The Kargil war of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The
war commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the Pakistan
army surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is thought to
be the brain-child of General Pervez Musharraf, then chief of the Pakistan Army. On 03 May
1999, intrusions were detected. On 26 May1, the first air to ground strike was launched by the
Indian Airforce (IAF), followed by Operation Vijay, by the Indian Army to evict the intruders
from the Indian territory2. After two months of violent confrontation, the war came to an end on
26 July 1999.
The Pakistan’s military leadership had long planned for the occupation of the ridgeline
dominating National Highway 1A on the Indian side of the LC, which they executed in 1998­
1999. One such point on the ridgeline was Chorbat La in the Batalik sub sector at 18000 feet
along the LC. Historically, Chorbat La was used as a gateway for intruders. The intrusion into
the Batalik sub-sector was undertaken to ease logistics for the Pakistan army. It, therefore,

(Pg no 104-105)became imperative to secure Chorbat La before India could initiate operations in other sectors.
Major Sonam Wangchuk was entrusted with the task of securing Chorbat La from the intruders
and the mission began on 28 May 1999.
On 28 May 1999, Major Sonam Wangchuk was tasked to establish an Observation Post on Ring
Contour in Chorbat La in Batalik sub-sector. Major Wangchuk joined the JCO and three jawans
at the firm base of Ring Contour, and started climbing the feature as they moved through fresh
snow. On 30 May 1999, at 0700 hours, the officer discovered about 3-4 enemy soldiers and
killed two of them, while the other escaped. Following the successful establishment of the
Observation Post, Major Wangchuk was assigned to reinforce another Observation Post along
the LC, which was expected to come under attack from Pakistani troops. After moving all night,
he arrived at the base of the Observation Post shortly before first light. He deployed his platoon
of two JCOs and twenty-five jawans to deter the enemy as the Post came under enemy artillery
bombardment and an attack was imminent. After nearly six hours of fighting, Major Wangchuk
arrived with one JCO and eleven jawans to reinforce the Observation Post. Thereafter with a
platoon, Major Wangchuk assaulted a feature near to the Observation Post held by the enemy
and captured it by killing six enemy soldiers. 'Sonam 1' and 'Sonam 2' are two posts in this
sector that have been named after him.
Major Wangchuk is a living legend from Ladakh Scouts. He displayed exemplary valour, and
courage in the face of the enemy in the most inhospitable weather and terrain conditions. He was
awarded Maha Vir Chakra for his action.CITATION
Major Sonam Wangchuk (IC-45952M), 3 Ladakh Scouts (IW)
(Effective date of the Award: 30 May, 1999)
On 28 May 1999 he was ordered to establish an Observation Post on Ring Contour in Chorbatla
sector. Moving through fresh snow of 1-2m, Major Sonam joined the JCO and three jawans at
the firm base of Ring Contour, and started climbing the feature. At about 0700 h on 30 May, he
noticed that 3-4 enemy soldiers and killed two of them while one of them managed to escape.
After successfully establishing the Observation Post, Major Sonam was moved to reinforce
another Observation Post on the Line of Control, which was expecting an attack from Pakistani
troops. Moving at night, he reached the base of the Observation Post just before first light. As the
Post was under enemy’s artillery fire and the attack was imminent, he deployed his platoon (of 2
JCO’s and twenty-five jawans) to deter the enemy. After facing enemy’s fire for nearly six
hours, finally the Observation Post was reinforced by Major Sonam, with 1 JCO and 11 Jawans.
Major Sonam assaulted a feature next to the Observation Post held by enemy with about a
platoon and captured it by killing six enemy soldiers. Two posts in this sector have been aptly
named after him as ‘Sonam 1’ and ‘Sonam2’. Major Sonam showed exemplary courage and
bravery, for which he was awarded Maha Vir Chakra.

the then Chief of the Army Staff. In the year 1999, during the Kargil War the men of this regiment
displayed exceptional bravery and fortitude in the capture of Tololing Heights.
The Kargil war of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict
can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan are the
attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. The war
commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the Pakistan army
surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is thought to be the
brain-child of General Pervez Musharraf, then chief of the Pakistan Army. On 03 May 1999,
intrusions were detected. On 26 May 1, the first air to ground strike was launched by the Indian
Airforce (IAF), followed by Operation Vijay, by the Indian Army to evict the intruders from the

out the Pakistani intruders. 56 Mountain Brigade was given the task to capture Tololing.
The Tololing Heights was the deepest penetration beyond the LC by the Pakistani intruders.
Tololing and another feature named Point 4590 were among the vital peaks for India. Both the
peaks were crucial as they overlooked the Dras sector and a large section of National Highway,
giving enemy a visual access to every movement on the National Highway. The intruders at the
Tololing top stayed put and didn’t open fire until they were discovered on 12 May 1999. This time
was utilized by the intruders to build coordinated defences that would enable the enemy to bring
effective fire on attacking troops.
On 22 May 1999, 18 Grenadiers launched their first attack on the Tololing top. The battalion made
several attempts yet, were only able to encircle them in the span of two weeks. During the attempts
to recapture the Tololing Top, 18 Grenadiers also lost a valiant officer Major Rajesh Singh
Adhikari on 30 May 1999. The responsibility to capture the top was then assigned to 2 Rajputana
Rifles (2 RAJ RIF), a regiment which operated in the valley and had undergone extensive training
at the Corps Battle School in Khrew. The unit of 2 RAJ RIF reached Dras Sector on 01 June 1999.
To recapture the Tololing top and the surrounding features, a multi-directional attack plan was
approved by Major General Mohinder Puri, General Officer Commanding 8 Mountain Division.
To ensure plan was a success, it was absolutely necessary to have adequate artillery fire unites for
each assaulting battalion, since the multi-directional attack should begin at the same time otherwise
enemy would guess the direction of attack and take appropriate action. However, later it was
decided to stagger the attack and ensure adequate artillery support for all assaulting troops.
The 2 RAJ RIF was tasked to capture the Tololing top by 0600 Hr on 13 June 1999. When the
battalion launched the attack, Major Vivek Gupta was in command of the leading Charlie
Company. Despite heavy artillery and automatic fire, the unit under Major Vivek Gupta's inspiring
leadership was able to close in with the enemy. The Company came under heavy fire from all sides
as soon as they emerged into the open. After three soldiers of the Company's leading section were
hit, the attack was temporarily stalled.

Major Vivek Gupta reacted quickly and fired a rocket launcher at the hostile position. Before the
enemy could regain command and control, he charged on to the hostile position. During the charge
he was hit by two bullets, yet he pressed on with the attack. Despite being wounded, he fought the
enemy in severe hand-to-hand fight. Upon reaching the area he managed to kill three enemy
soldiers. Inspired by their officer's valiant deed the rest of the company surged onto the enemy
position and captured it. Major Vivek Gupta, was yet again hit by enemy gunfire and got grievously
injured and succumbed to his injuries on the battlefield.

that his son found himself where he always wanted to be, right where the action was.The battalion of Major Vivek Gupta remembers him as a great singer and a keen bodybuilder.
In the face of the enemy, Major Vivek Gupta demonstrated noteworthy courage and inspired
leadership, which contributed to the conquest of Tololing Top. For his supreme sacrifice, he was
awarded Maha Vir Chakra posthumously.CITATION

Vivek Gupta was able to close in with the enemy. As soon as the Company emerged in the open,
they came under multidirectional intense fire. Three personnel of the leading section of the

Knowing fully well that staying any longer in the open under the murderous enemy fire would lead
to more losses, Major Vivek Gupta reacted immediately and fired a rocket launcher at the enemy
position. Before the shocked enemy could recover, Major Vivek Gupta charged on to the enemy
position. While so charging, he was hit by two bullets, despite which, he kept moving towards the
position. On reaching the position, he engaged the enemy in fierce hand to hand combat and
managed to kill three enemy soldiers despite his own injuries.
Taking inspiration form the gallant deed of their officer, the rest of the company charged onto the
enemy position and captured it. However, in the ensuing combat, Major Vivek Gupta received
another direct hit of enemy bullets and finally succumbed to his injuries.
Major Vivek Gupta displayed conspicuous gallantry and inspiring leadership in the face of the
enemy, which ultimately led to the capture of Tololing Top.

recapture the Tololing heights. Tololing and another feature named Point 4590 were among thevital peaks for India. Both the peaks were crucial to capture as they overlooked the Dras sector
and a large section of National Highway, giving enemy an access to every movement on the
National Highway. 18 GRENADIERS is known as the ‘Pole Star Battalion’ for its steadfastness
in the battlefield. Staying true to their name, within the time frame of five days the battalion

in a treacherous mountainous terrain blanketed with snow. While Major Adhikari was leading his
company towards the objective, he was fired at by Universal machine guns from two mutually
supporting enemy positions. The officer ordered the rocket launcher detachment to engage the
enemy position killing two enemy soldiers. Under heavy fire, the officer ordered his medium
machine gun detachment to take position behind a rocky feature and engage the enemy. Major
Adhikari sustained serious bullet wounds while advancing ahead, yet he continued to direct his
sub-unit. Refusing to be evacuated, he charged at the second enemy position and killed one more

He was highly patriotic and from a very young age dreamt of becoming an officer. He studied in
Army Public School Dhaula Kuan and was a keen volleyball player. In an interview, Mrs Meena
Nayyar while talking about her son said that he displayed strong leadership since his childhood.
When a young Anuj Nayyar was waiting outside the Allahabad SSB Centre, he confidently told
his father, “I am going to make it, Poppin. I promise you”. He was commissioned in the Indian
Army on 07 June 1997 in the Jat Regiment.
The Jat Regiment is one of the oldest regiments of the Indian Army. It is an infantry regiment
that claims its origins to the Calcutta Native Militia raised in 1795, which later became an
infantry battalion of the Bengal Army. Jat people were historically considered to be martial class
and were enlisted in the British Army when the policy on class regiments came. In 1922, during
the grouping of the class regiment the 9 Jat Regiment was formed by bringing under a single
regiment, four active and one training battalion. In the post-independent era, the Jat regiment had
lived up to their reputation and holds the distinction of fighting in all the wars that India fought
since its independence including the IPKF to Sri Lanka. Their battle cry: Jat Balwan, Jai
Bhagwan was adopted in 1955. 17 JAT received “Unit","” from the Chief of the Army

imperative for the Indian Army to clear the enemy from these features to secure the highway. After
successful eviction of enemy from Tololing, the 2 Rajputana Rifles was tasked to capture Area
Three Pimples Complex in the Dras sector. It is a cluster of sharp conical features in close
proximity to each other between Sando and Tololing Nullahs and comprises of Knoll, Three

on the information from the patrols, it was decided that the best approach to attack Three Pimples
was from the South-East direction. Captain Neikezhakuo Kenguruse was tasked to lead the Ghatak
platoon to take down an enemy machine gun position located on a dominating height that was
hindering the advance of the battalion from approaching the objective.

under heavy machine gun fire and Captain Kenguruse sustained splinter wounds in his abdomen.
Despite bleeding profusely, he did not yield and motivated his men to continue the advance. The
final hurdle was a rock wall that separated them from the enemy machine gun post. In an act of

Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (JAK LI) is an infantry regiment of the Indian Army. The
regimental history of JAK LI is very unique. In 1947, when Pakistani troops intruded into the
Indian territory, militia groups were raised from the locals of Jammu, Nubra and Leh under the
Ministry of Home Affairs. The militia fought with great distinction in the 1965 India-Pakistan
War. However, it was the gallant action of the militia troops in the India-Pakistan War of 1971
that earned them three battle honours. After the war in 1972, the militia was converted into a
full-fledged regiment and in 1976 the name was changed to Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry.
The JAK LI has been deployed in the Indian Peacekeeping Force in Sri Lanka in 1987 and also

(Pg no 104-105)The challenges in the Batalik sub-sector were manifold as the enemy had intruded almost 8-10
km from the LC and occupied an unheld area west of the Chorbat La Pass. The 12 JAK LI was
given the task of driving a wedge betwee the enemy’s defences at Point 5203 (eastern extremity)
to that of Point 4812, Point 5287, Point 5000 (the Khalubar ridgeline). Colonel VS Bhalotia, the
commanding officer of 12 JAK LI planned to execute a multi-directional attack on Point 4812.
He planned to execute an assault with two columns of Charlie Company under Major DK Pathak
and Lieutenant KC Nongrum where tasked to assault from North and East side respectively. A
column of Bravo Company led by Captain Sanjeev Dhiman was to assault from the South and
one column each from Delta Company and Alpha Company under Major TS Bhandari and Major
Rupinder Singh were nominated as reserves. On 30 June 1999, at 2030 Hours the assault troop
set out and the attacking columns reached their respective positions by 0300 Hours on 1 July
1999. During the action along the Eastern approach, Lieutenant Nongrum’s column came under
enemy fire from a sangar and two riflemen were killed. Lieutenant Nongrum did the near
impossible task of climbing up a near-vertical cliff at Point 4812 and achieved success.

South Eastern direction in the Batalik sector. He climbed a near-vertical cliff and upon reaching
the top, his column was fired at by the enemy, who had the advantage of well prepared and
coordinated defences. The enemy had well established interconnected bunkers made of boulders
and stones to protect them from artillery fire. The enemy open fired at Lieutenant Nongrum’s
column with automatic weapons. He charged at the enemy through the fire zone with complete
disregard for his personal safety. On closing in with the enemy position Lieutenant Nongrum
lobbed grenades at the first position killing six enemy soldiers. He then tried to snatch the

On the night of 30 June/01 July 1999, in an operation to capture Point 4812 in the Batalik sector,
Lieutenant Keishing Clifford Nongrum was tasked to assault the feature from the South Eastern
direction. He led his column over the near impossible vertical cliff feature. On reaching the top,
his column encountered strong enemy opposition. The enemy was well entrenched in
interconnected positions carved out of boulders and remained immune to even artillery fire.
The enemy pinned down the column of Lieutenant Keishing Clifford Nongrum with heavy and
accurate automatic fire for about two hours. On seeing the futility of own fire against the
fortified enemy position, Lieutenant Nongrum, with utter disregard to his personal safety,
charged through the fire zone. Closing in with the first position, he threw grenades into it and
killed six enemy soldiers. He then tried to snatch the universal machine gun of the enemy from
the second enemy position and received a volley of bullets.
The audacious action of Lieutenant Keishing Clifford Nongrum stunned the enemy giving
valuable reaction time to his troops to close in and finally clear the position. Though severely
wounded, he refused to be evacuated and fought valiantly till he succumbed to his injuries. This
act resulted in the ultimate capture of Point 4812.
Lieutenant Keishing Clifford Nongrum displayed conspicuous bravery, dogged determination
and raw courage in the face of the enemy and made the supreme sacrifice in the highest
traditions of the Indian Army.

Shobha Chand, a decorated veteran of 2 Jat Battalion of the Indian Army and mother Smt Pateri
Devi. He is native of a small village named Sasroli near Jahjjhar, Haryana. His father served in
the 2 JAT Indian Army, as a soldier. He grew up listening to stories of Indian Army’s valour and
sacrifice. Since childhood, Lt Singh knew he was destined to be a soldier. He did his primary
education from a small village school and completed his secondary schooling from Sainik School
Kunjpura, Karnal. Later, he went on to pursue a bachelor’s degree and graduated from the
University College Rohtak. Fulfilling his dream of joining the army, Lt Singh joined Officers
Training Academy, Chennai, and was commissioned into the Indian Army on 6 March 1999.
During the Kargil War, Lieutenant Balwan Singh was Ghatak platoon commander of
18 GRENADIERS.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and
Kashmir by any means. The Kargil war of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The war
commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the Pakistan army
surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is thought to be the
brain-child of General Pervez Musharraf, then chief of the Pakistan Army. On 3 May 1999,
intrusions were detected. On 26 May 1, the first air to ground strike was launched by the Indian

the Indian army, which was formerly part of the Bombay Army and in pre-independence India,
the regiment was known as the 4th Bombay Grenadiers. They distinguished themselves in two
world wars and have won battle honors Gurez, Assal Uttar, Jarpal and Chakra among others.
During the Kargil War, 18 GRENADIERS distinguished themselves for capturing the formidable
Tiger Hill and for their successful attack on the Hump. Along with the remarkable contribution in
the recapture of Tiger Hill, 18 GRENADIERS also aided the capture of Tololing heights.

(Pg no 104-105)18 GRENADIERS, which is also known as the ‘Pole Star Battalion’ had already lost two valiant
officers, Lt. Col R. Viswanathan and Major Rajesh Singh Adhikari, when they were assigned the
task to capture the Tiger Hill. The Tiger Hill complex is one of the most dominating and awe­
inspiring features in the Dras sector. The Pakistani soldiers who had occupied the Tiger Hill
complex in strength were bringing effective artillery on large tracts of the National Highway 1A.
Eviction of the enemy from this feature was urgent and necessary. The Tiger hill was the key to
enemy position in the Dras Sector. The tiger hill complex was isolated from the North, South and
East by 8 SIKH on 21 May 1999. However, the isolation from the West could not be done as the
complete ridge line was occupied by the enemy. The Indian Army moreover was not permitted to
cross the Line of Control to get behind the enemy to cut his line of communication.3 To completely
isolate the enemies on Tiger Hill, Colonel Kaushal Thakur the commanding officer of 18
GRENADIERS, applied the lessons learnt earlier at the Tololing and Hump and decided a
multidirectional attack, with the majority of force level assaulting from unexpected direction. The
attack on Tiger Hill commenced on 3 July 1999 at 2030 hours. By 0400 Hours of 5 July 1999, 18
GRENADIERS and 8 SIKH were able to capture several important features of Tiger Hill and
succeeded in completely isolating the enemy sitting at the Tiger Hill top.
Lt Balwan Singh was leading the Ghatak Platoon of 18 GRENADIERS which was assigned the
task to assault the ‘Tiger Hill Top’. The Ghatak Platoon is a special platoon present in every
infantry battalion of the Indian Army. Only physically fit and motivated soldiers make it to the
Ghatak Platoon. ‘Ghatak’ means ‘fatal’ in English. The Ghatak soldiers are well-trained, well­
armed and equipped to handle situations like terror strikes, and counter-insurgency operations.
They are also capable of directing artillery and air attacks on targets deep within enemy lines. This
platoon is usually 20-man strong, including an officer and 2 JCOs.
Lt Balwan Singh and his Ghatak platoon were entrusted with assaulting the 'Tiger Hill Top' from
the north-east as part of a multi-pronged attack on 3 July 1999. The path to the objective, which
was at a height of 16,500 feet, was snow-covered and dotted with precipitous drops. The officer,
with just three months service, set about his task with single-minded determination. To reach the
designated spur, the team led and exhorted by him marched for over twelve hours via an extremely
difficult and precarious terrain and under intense artillery shelling.
3 Cardozo, Ian. (2003). Param Vir : Our Heroes In Battle (pg no-172)This move caught the enemy completely off guard, as his team used cliff assault mountaineering
equipment to reach the summit. The enemy panicked when they saw the Ghataks and attempted to
repel them in a desperate firefight. Lieutenant Balwan Singh was critically injured in the ensuing
combat. Lt Balwan Singh's will to finish the enemy remained unshaken despite his injuries. He
refused to be evacuated and, despite his injuries, went quickly to encircle the enemy and confront
them in close combat, killing four enemy soldiers single-handedly. The remaining enemy soldiers
chose to flee rather than face the impending death.
The officer's inspiring leadership, bravery, and daring were vital in the conquest of Tiger Hill,
which was the Drass sector's most critical operational objectives. On 11 July 1999, the Ghataks
captured the Tiger Hill Top, a national objective.
The determination, raw courage, and grit displayed by all ranks of 18 GRENADIERS during the
capture of Tiger Hill was exemplary and worthy of emulation. The capture of Tiger Hill remains
among the most difficult objectives to be captured by the Indian Army.","Lieutenant Balwan Singh (SS-37691), 18 Grenadiers

Naik Digendra Singh, was a part of 2 Rajputana Rifles (2 RAJ RIF) which was deployed in Dras
sector of Jammu and Kashmir for the capture of Tololing heights. The Rajputana Rifles is the senior
most Rifle Regiment of the Indian Army. Its first battalion was raised in January 1775. The Rajputana
Rifles has a long and glorious history. The regiment took part in some of the bloodiest battles in many
theatres of the world. During World War II, the battalions of this regiment fought in every theatre in which
the Indian Army was involved. Three of them, the 1st, 4th and Medium Machine Gun Battalions fought in
Eritrea in North Africa and Italy as part of the famous 4th Indian Division, whose fighting record was one
of the finest in World War II. Post-independence the regiment took part in many battles and operations
including the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Congo. The Rajputana Rifles fought gallantly in the 1965 and
1971 India-Pakistan wars. During the Kargil War, the Rajputana Rifles displayed exemplary valour and
determination especially in the Tololing Operation. The 2 RAJ RIF was conferred India’s first ‘Instant Unit","’ by General VP Malik, the then Chief of the Army Staff. In the year 1999, during the Kargil
War the men of this regiment displayed exceptional bravery and fortitude in the capture of Tololing

(Pg no 104-105)The Tololing Heights was the deepest penetration beyond the LC by the Pakistani intruders.
Tololing and another feature named Point 4590 were among the vital peaks for India. Both the
peaks were crucial as they overlooked the Dras sector and a large section of National Highway,
giving enemy a visual access to every movement on the National Highway. The intruders at the
Tololing top stayed put and didn’t open fire until they were discovered on 12 May 1999. This time
was utilized by the intruders to build such an infrastructure that every movement of assaulting
Indian troops would be met by heavy volume of accurate firepower.
On 22 May 1999, 18 GRENADIERS launched their first attack on the Tololing top. The battalion
attempted several such remarkable attacks yet, were only able to encircle the enemy position in
the span of two weeks. During the attempts to recapture the Tololing Top, 18 GRENADIERS also
lost a valiant officer Major Rajesh Singh Adhikari on 30 May 1999. The responsibility to capture
the top was then assigned to 2 RAJ RIF, a regiment which operated in the valley and had undergone
extensive training at the Corps Battle School in Khrew. 2 RAJ RIF was inducted into the area from
the Kashmir valley and it reached Dras Sector on 1 June 1999.
To recapture Tololing top and the surrounding features, a multi-directional plan was approved by
Major General Mohinder Puri General Officer Commanding 8Mountain Division. To ensure this
attempt is a success, it was absolutely necessary to have adequate number of artillery fire units for
each assaulting battalion.It was essential that the multi-directional attack should begin at the same
time, as per plan, otherwise enemy would guess the position and take appropriate action. However,
when the difficulty arose in the allotment of artillery, it was decided to commence the attacks
within an hour or forty-five minutes of each other, to give adequate fire support to each assaulting
column.
On 13 June 1999, at 0600 Hr, Naik Digendra Kumar’s company attacked on Tololing feature in
the Drass sector. He was the commander of the light machine gun group. The goal was to capture
a well-defended enemy position. While the Assault Group was approaching its target, it came
under heavy enemy fire from well concealed universal machine guns (UMG), heavy machine guns
(HMG), and various small weapons causing several casualties in the assault group. A gunshot
struck Naik Digendra Kumar in the left arm. Naik Digendra Kumar, undeterred by his own
wounded, continued to fire with one hand, bringing effective and accurate light machine gun fire
on the attackers. While Indian soldiers advanced towards the target, his precise fire kept the
enemy's head down. Despite his critical injuries, the accurate fire support ensured the Assault
Group was able to finally capture the objective. In the face of the enemy, Naik Digendra Kumar

Before India gained independence from the British Empire, the regiment consisted of Rajputs and
Punjabi Muslims. The regimental insignia is a pair of crossed Rajputi Katars flanked by three
Ashoka leaves on either side. This is mounted by the Lion Capital of Ashoka and a scroll below
with the words ""The Rajput Regiment"". The regimental motto of Rajput Regiment is ‘Sarvatra
Vijaya’ meaning ‘Victory everywhere’. 1 RAJPUT was later redesignated as 4 GUARDS.
The Brigade of The Guards is a regiment of the Indian Army. The troops from all parts of the
country serve together in various battalions of this regiment. The Brigade of the Guards was raised
to implement government’s policy of encouraging army recruitment from regions which had been
under-represented in the forces. Three of army's oldest battalions - 2 PUNJAB, 1 GRENADIERS,
and 1 RAJPTANA RIFLES were converted as the GUARDS battalions in 1949. In 1950 1
RAJPUT was converted to 4 GUARDS. During the first war of Kashmir 1 RAJPUT (4 GUARDS)
showed their mettle in the battle of Tain Dhar, where Naik Jadunath Singh fought valiantly and
won the first Param Vir Chakra for his Regiment.2
The first Indo-Pak war fought between the independent countries of India and Pakistan began in
1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan were the attempts by Pakistan to annex
the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. On the map of India, the state of Jammu
and Kashmir appeared as a somewhat rectangular projection in the extreme North-West corner of

before the birth of Pakistan, Jammu and Kashmir was surrounded on almost three sides by foreign
states. Today, its importance has been accentuated by recent international developments. To the
East lay Tibet; to its North lies Chinese Turkestan or Sinkiang (Xinjiang); to West is Afghanistan;

3 Operations in Jammu and Kashmir S.N. Prasad. Dr. Dharam Pal (2005). Natraj Publishers and Ministry of
Defence,Government of IndiaOn 01 February 1948, 50 (Independent) PARA Brigade launched an attack at night and captured
Naushera by the morning of 02 February. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and withdrew from
their position. Enraged at this reverse, Pakistan launched a massive attack from different directions
on 06 February 1948 with 15000 raiders to recapture Naushera and a grim battle ensued. Tain
Dhar, a hill feature immediately overlooking Naushera received particular attention where
repeated attacks were launched by the enemy. 1 RAJPUT held the feature and inflicted heavy
casualties on the enemy. It was here that several gallant actions took place including hard hand to
hand fighting.
On 06 February 1948, stung and mortified at the loss of Kot, the enemy launched an all -out attack
on Naushera. The picquets at Tain Dhar received the brunt of attack by 3000 Pathans of Swat and
Dir, using mortars, machine-guns, and grenades. The enemy under cover of darkness had crept up
to the Indian picquets and defensive locations on commanding features. At first light, the men in
picquets and posts saw thousands of armed men creeping into the Indian territory. This was also
the battle in which the gallant Naik Jadunath Singh was awarded natin’s highest gallantry award
the Param Vir Chakra for his conspicuous bravery and sacrifice. The battle of Tain Dhar during
1947-48 War has gone down in the annals of military history as one of the toughest battles fought
by an Infantry Battalion.
During the battle of Major Brijpal Singh was Second in Command of 1 RAJPUT. On o6 February,
he was informed about the near annihilation of the forward most section of his battalion by the
enemy but some men were still resisting the enemy’s advance and the post had not yet fallen. Since
the reinforcement had not yet arrived, Major Singh collected some twelve men from the Battalion
Headquarters and rushed forward immediately. After having regrouped, the enemy launched
another attack on the post with more vigour. Though heavily outnumbered, the twelve men held
on and broke the momentum of the enemy’s attack. Major Singh moved from trench to trench,
inspiring the men. He kept on inspiring his men to fight the enemy to the last man, which broke
the enemy morale, and eventually the enemy had to retreat leaving many casualties behind.4
Major Brijpal Singh displayed gallantry, inspiring leadership, and exemplary tenacity throughout
the action and was awarded Vir Chakra for his dauntless courage.

Naushera. Major Brijpal Singh, who was in charge of a picquet with only two platoons under him,
repulsed the attacks several times inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.
Regardless of his personal safety, Major Brijpal Singh kept on inspiring his men to fight the enemy

JC- 51790,Risaldar & Hony Captain (then Naib,Noor Mohammad Khan,18 CAVALRY,"Risaldar & Hony Captain (then Naib Risaldar) Noor Mohammad Khan was born on 30
December 1930, to Shri Taj Mohammad Khan, in Jodhpur District of Rajasthan. He was enrolled
into the 18 CAVALRY on 30 December 1948 at the age of 18. During the Indo-Pak War of
1971, Naib Risaldar Noor Mohammad Khan was a Troop Leader in B Squadron of the
Regiment.
The 18th Cavalry is an old and illustrious Armoured Regiment of the Armoured Corps of the
Indian Army. The regiment was created in 1921 through the amalgamation of 6th King Edward's
Own Cavalry which was raised in 1842 and the 7th Hariana Lancers which was raised in 1846.
The composition of the Regiment after the amalgamation in 1921 consisted of Kaimkhanis,
Rajputana, Rajputs, and Jats. The present class composition is of Jats from Uttar Pradesh,
Haryana and Rajasthan; Rajputs from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan and
Hindustani Mussalmans from all over India, but mainly from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and West
Bengal. In the Second sWorld War, the Regiment was sent to North Africa and fought in the
Battle of Tobruk . When India was partitioned in 1947 and the Indian Army split between the
new created states of India and Pakistan, the 18th King Edward's Own Cavalry was allocated to
India. When India became a republic in 1950, the Regiment's title was changed to that of 18th
Cavalry. During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 the Regiment equipped with up gunned
Shermans had led the advance of 26 Infantry Division in the Sialkot Sector and naib Risaldar
Ayub Khan was awarded the Vir Chakra. In 1971, the Regiment saw action in the Fazilka
Sector. Naib Risaldar Noor Mohammed Khan was awarded the Vir Chakra. The hard work done
and sacrifices made by the valiant soldiers of this Regiment have been duly recognised by the 29
Battle and Theatre honours received by the Regiment, which is the second highest in the
Armoured Corps. General Dalbir Singh, PVSM, UYSM, AVSM, VSM the 25th Chief of the
Army Staff, was the Honorary Colonel of the Regiment and his father Risaldar Major Ramphal
Singh (Retired) had served with distinction during both the Indo-Pak War of 1965 & 1971.
The 1971 War was a military conflict between India and Pakistan during the Bangladesh
Liberation War from 03 to 16 December 1971. It began with preemptive airstrikes by the
Pakistan Air Force on Indian targets, leading to India’s involvement in support of Bengali
nationalist forces. Pakistan suffered a significant defeat in this War. The Indo-Pak War of 1971
was the first war when the Indian Government engaged all three services on a large scale. A total
of 4,090 Indian soldiers made the supreme sacrifice during this war and about 600 officers and
men of the Indian Armed Forces were decorated with Gallantry awards. Of these, 04 were Param
Vir Chakra, 76 Maha Vir Chakra and 513 Vir Chakra.
India had anticipated that Pakistan could attack Fazilka through the Enclaves, located to the south
of river Satluj. An attack was also expected from the North, through Jalalabad or from the
Sulaimanke Bridgehead in the West. There was also an assessment that Pakistan would try to
lean against the defences on the Sabuna Distributary. After the Indo-Pak War 1965, India had
constructed an anti-tank obstacle in the shape of the Sabuna Distributary, about 10 to 13 km from
the town of Fazilka, which covered all the approaches. The alignment of the Distributary was
parallel to the International Boundary, covered 22 kms from the Gang Canal to Fazilka Creek,
and provided for many fortifications. The Salem Shah Nala, just North of the Fazilka town
constituted a hurdle, while the Chandbhan drain, 13 km North of Fazilka, was a major obstacle.67(Independent) Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier SS Choudhary was deployed for the
defence of Fazilka, comprised three Infantry Battalions (15 RAJPUT, 3 ASSAM, 4 JAT), 4
(Independent) Armoured Squadron of Deccan Horse equipped with Sherman tanks, one
Squadron 18 Cavalry equipped with T-54 tanks and two Troops 70 Armoured Regiment with
Jonga mounted SS11B1 missiles. It was supported by one Field Regiment and one Medium
Battery. Two BSF battalions were also under command.
All planning and preparations for the main defensive battle centred on Fazilka, which was to be
held at all cost. The line Sabuna Distributary-Qadir Bakhsh-Muazzam was to be held by a strong
Covering Force.

However, as the operational responsibility of the 67 (Independent) Infantry Brigade extended
over a large territory and there was shortage of troops, the Battalions were so deployed as to build
up either on the Sabuna Distributary or on Fazilka, depending on the direction of threat. Shortly
before the commencement of hostilities the Brigade was placed under command Foxtrot Sector
commanded by Major General Ram Singh. The Brigade was deployed across various areas as
follows: In the Shatirwala Area on the Sabuna Distributary, the deployment included 15
RAJPUT, less two Companies; three Companies from the 28 BSF Battalion; and two Companies
from the 22 BSF Battalion. In the Chananwala-Choriwala Chisti-Qadir Bakhsh-Khokhar Area
and along the Sabuna Distributary, the forces comprised 3 ASSAM, with one Company and two
Platoons from the 22 BSF Battalion; two Troops of 'B' Squadron 18 CAVALRY.In the Muazzam-Fazilka region, North of the Railway Line Fazilka-Muktsar, the deployment
included two Companies of 15 RAJPUT and two Companies of 22 BSF Battalion. For the
Fazilka-South of Railway Line Fazilka-Muktsar area, the forces consisted of 4 JAT, 4
(Independent) Armoured Squadron, and B Squadron 18 CAVALRY less two Troops commanded
by Major Baldev Bawa.
On the evening of 03 December, B Company of Pakistan's 6 Frontier Force, led by Major Shabir
Sharif (the elder brother of General Raheel Sharif, the 9th Chief of Pakistan’s Army ), executed a
surprise assault and seized the Beriwala Bridge on the Sabuna Distributary. Initial reports from
border outposts indicated the sound of tanks approaching from the enemy side. Around 1800
hours, Major BS Bawa was ordered to position two Troops alongside the infantry. Lieutenant DS
Sirohi moved to Pakka across the Distributary, while one Troop was deployed to the Bridge on
the Fazilka-Pakka road. By approximately 1845 hours, the enemy began shelling, and shortly
after sunset, they launched an attack on several Border Outposts, overrunning Jhangar BOP,
which was located in front of the Bridge.
3 ASSAM, which was defending the Beriwala Bridge, was forced to vacate the position. The
situation created confusion in the fog of war for the 67 Infantry Brigade, leading them to believe
that the enemy had taken control of 'Outfall' near the Creek, the northernmost point of the
distributary where the Sutlej River flows back. Major BS Bawa was instructed to counterattack
this area, with 'D' Company of 4 JAT placed under his command. The counterattack commenced
at 2045 hours, but as a squadron with two troops advanced, they came under fire from the
Beriwala Bridge, resulting in the loss of two tanks near Village Gurmukh Khera, and Major
Bawa was injured by artillery fire. Despite this, he was ordered to proceed for the 'Outfall.' This
decision proved costly. B Squadron, with two Troops, led the charge to ‘Outfall’ and managed to
recapture and secure the Bridge at the Creek by 0330 hours on 04 December. However, two tanks
got bogged down, and D Company of 4 JAT incurred casualties due to intense artillery fire at the
FUP.
They were then reassigned to capture Beriwala Bridge, but heavy enemy fire prevented any
progress. Major Bawa was struck in the forehead by a splinter and had to be evacuated. Captain
RKV Reddy took command until Major (later Brigadier) AP Bhargava, the Second-in-Command
of the Regiment, assumed leadership of the Squadron later that day. Meanwhile, 3 ASSAM was
working to stabilize the situation along the Sabuna Distributary, but the full extent of enemy
encroachment remained unclear. As Major Rana of 3 ASSAM moved up in a tank to pinpoint an
enemy MMG position, the tank was hit by a direct shell, and Major Rana along with two crew
members were unable to escape before the vehicle engulfed in flames. During the counterattack,
the strongpoint at Pakka reported an enemy assault just after midnight, leading to the withdrawal
of all three strongpoints.
The evacuation of screen positions and the loss of border outposts caused widespread panic,
prompting Brigadier Surjit Singh Choudhary to order the demolition of all bridges on the Sabuna
Distributary on 04 December, 1971, at 1100 hours. This decision overlooked the strategic
importance of retaining these bridges for potential counterattacks. One tank from the Troop under3 ASSAM remained across the Ditch cum Bundh (DCB) at Pakka and was captured by the
enemy. Engagements continued throughout the day, but by evening, the enemy had consolidated
their position, holding about 700 yards of the Sabuna Distributary, including the Beriwala Bridge,
and had expanded their bridgehead into Gurmukh Khera village. The crew had strayed far to the
left and hit the enemy defences.
There were only five tanks in the Squadron on road, as five were bogged down, including three
which were close to defences occupied by 3 ASSAM. Three tanks had been hit and one captured
at Pakka. Orders were also given to abandon the defences along the obstacles during the night for
which B Squadron was tasked to cover withdrawal. At about 2030 hours, 3 ASSAM reported an
enemy attack on their right flank; contact was established with the crew of bogged down tanks.
Naib Risaldar Noor Mohammad Khan was the Troop Leader t. On the night of 03 December.
1971, his Squadron was ordered to launch an attack in an area in the Western Sector. When he
reached the area, he found his Squadron Commander's tank had bogged down. He tried to
recover this tank, exposing himself to heavy enemy fire. Since the tank could not be recovered,
he offered his own tank to the Squadron Commander and stayed back with the bogged down
tank. Later, when the enemy in a Platoon strength attacked his tank, he opened up his cupola
and fired with the Machine Gun, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Naib Risaldar Noor
Mohammand Khan was awarded with the Vir Chakra for his courage and valour in the face of
the enemy.
The operations in Fazilka sector were characterized by fierce fighting, stretching over a period of
fourteen days. 4 JAT, 3/11 GORKHA RIFLES and 15 RAJPUTS suffered heavy casualties,
mainly caused by small arms and artillery shelling. In these operations Indian casualties mounted
to 189 killed (including 11 officers and 10 JCOs), 425 wounded and 196 missing.","Naib Risaldar NOOR MOHAMMAD KHAN (IC-51790),

village in Mahendragarh, District of Haryana. His father’s name was Ghisa Ram Yadav. Lance
Havildar Angna Ram was enrolled into 1 (PARA) KUMAON on 24 October 1940. He fought in
the first Indo-Pak War of 1948-48 and displayed considerable skill and gallantry in the capture of
Point 6370 feature that dominated Rajauri-Poonch and Rajauri-Mendhar road in Jammu &
Kashmir. It was a vital post. Lance Havildar Angna Ram was awarded Vir Chakra for his display
of gallantry in the face of enemy during the action. He served 25 years in the army as a seasoned
paratrooper and retired on 31 October 1965 as Honorary Naib Subedar.
The KUMAON Regiment traces its origins to the 18th century and has fought in every major
campaign of the British Indian Army and the Indian Army including the two world wars. During
World War I, a Kumaon battalion was raised at Ranikhet on 23 October 1917 as 34/39th Kumaon
Rifles. In 1918, it was redesigned as 1st battalion, 50th Kumaon Rifles and a second battalion was
raised. These were merged with Hyderabad contingent into the 19th Hyderabad Regiment in 1923.
On 27 October 1945, the 19th Hyderabad was renamed as 19 Kumaon Regiment. Post
Independence, it has been known as the Kumaon Regiment. Staying true to the regimental motto
of Parakramo Vijayate (Valour Triumphs) the regiment has proved its mettle in Indo-Pak War of
1947-48, Sino-India War of 1962, Indo-Pak War 1971, Kargil War of 1999 and also participated
in the Indian Peace-keeping Force in Sri Lanka. During the Sino-India War of 1962, 13 KUMAON
displayed conspicuous courage and undaunted determination while fighting the enemy during the
Battle of Rezang La, where Major Shaitan Singh received the Param Vir Chakra.1 The KUMAON
Regiment has contributed three Chiefs to the Indian Army namely General SM Shringesh, General
KS Thimayya, DSO and General TN Raina, MVC.
The senior most battalion of the Regiment, 1 KUMAON was converted to the Airborne role in
1946. It fought with distinction in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 as 1 PARA (KUMAON). It
remained a part of the regiment until April 1952 when it was formally inducted into the Parachute
Regiment as 3 PARA (KUMAON). Later in 2000, the battalion was converted to Special Forces
as part of the expansion of the special operations forces of the Indian Army, and renamed 3rd
Battalion Para (Special Forces) or 3 PARA (SF).
The Parachute Regiment is an airborne and special forces regiment of the Indian Army. It was
raised in 1945 as part of the British Indian Army but was disbanded after the World War II and
was re-raised in 1952 by absorbing the three existing parachute battalions of the 50th Parachute
Brigade. In the post-independence restructuring, India retained only one Parachute Brigade—the
50th. This Brigade consisted of three distinguished battalions personally nominated by the then
1 Ballabh, Anand, Insights into Infantry Regiments: A Basic Factbook. Forward Books publications. New Delhi (2013)Commander-in-Chief, namely 1 PARA (PUNJAB), 2 PARA (MARATHA) and 3 PARA
(KUMAON). During the Jammu and Kashmir operations of 1947-48 these battalions
distinguished themselves with glory in the battles of Shelatang, Naushera, Jhangar and Poonch,
and were awarded the respective Battle Honours. On 15 April 1952, the three battalions serving
with the Parachute Brigade were removed from their respective Infantry Regiments to form the
PARACHUTE REGIMENT. Since then, The Regiment has participated in 1962 War, 1971 War,
Op PAWAN, Op CACTUS, and 1999 Kargil War. Currently it comprises seven Special Forces,
six Airborne, two Territorial Army and one Rashtriya Rifles Battalions.

By the end of May 1948, the Poonch Brigade had succeeded in consolidating its position. The
stage was now set up for an operation for the link up with 19 Brigade’s advance from Rajauri to
Thana Mandi and Surankot, where the Link up was to be affected with a battalion of Poonch
Brigade from Poonch. Lieutenant General S M Shrinagesh, who was appointed Corps Commander
in overall command of J&K Force on 14 September 1948 was planning for operation ‘EASY’ for
the final link up with Poonch. An attempt to link up Poonch could be made either from the South,
namely via Thana Mandi or Rajauri, or form the North via the Haji Pir Pass. Lieutenant General
Cariappa didn’t approve of the plan for the link up by the North route but sanctioned the link upwith Poonch by the Southern route. By 28 October, 268 Infantry Brigade and 5 Infantry Brigade
succeeded in capturing two vital ridges for the link up, Pir Badesar and Pir Kalewa respectively.
The objective was now to capture Ramgarh fort and Bhimbar Gali, preparatory to the capture of
Mendhar and the advance to Poonch.
Brigadier Yadunath Singh, commander of Durga Force, which was to undertake Operation EASY
and was composed of 5 Infantry Brigade, 19 Infantry Brigade and the Rajauri Garrison., planned
to make two brigades converge on Bhimbar Gali – 5 Infantry Brigade Group, operating from Pir
Kalewa and Point 6980 to Bhimbar Gali and 19 Infantry Brigade Group capturing Point 6944 to
Point 6307. The third Brigade was protecting the left flank of the two attacking columns. The phase
I of the operation was to start by capturing Point 4844, Ramgarh Fort and Point 6480.
5 Infantry Brigade secured the left flank of Bhimbar Gali by capturing Point 6911 and Point 6980.
Meanwhile, to secure the Right Flank, 19 Infantry Brigade was capturing the ridge from Point
6944 to Point 6360. 45 Field Battery (less Troop) was in support of the Brigade along with SQN
No.10 RIAF, SQN No. 12 RIAF and No 1 AOP (RFT) RIAF were available for air support.
1 (PARA) KUMAON started climbing the feature, Point 6307, after crossing a Nala on 07
November. Advance went on smoothly but slowly as it was a very rough country and steep
climbing up to Dhori Dhara. It was during this action, when Lieutenant Colonel Dharam Singh,
the Commanding Officer of the Battalion displayed bravery, initiative and strong leadership
making the attack successful.
Lance Havildar Angna Ram was Section Commander in No.3 Platoon of ‘A” Company. During
the action, his Section came under heavy automatic and machine gun fire. The attack commenced
with fervour but was soon stalled by the heavy enemy fire. The enemy made use of hand grenades
when the Platoon came into grips with them. Lance Havildar Angna Ram waited for some time,
and though wounded by a grenade splinter, he, with four Jawans, led a bayonet charge. They soon
dashed forward and and mounted on the objective engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Lance
Havildar Angna Ram killed two hostiles on the spot, despite being injured. The soon captured the
position. Without his exemplary courage, the feature could not have been captured so easily and
the advance of the battalion to the main objective made possible. Enemy offered resistance from
four other tactical features but all resistance were overcome and Point 6307, the objective, was
secured at 0600 hours on 08 November.
Lance Havildar Angna Ram was awarded Vir Chakra for his display of exceptional courage,
devotion to duty and sparkling leadership in the face of enemy.","15780 Lance Havildar ANGNA RAM, 1 (Para) Bn Kumaon Regiment. (08-11-48)

2During the war the Indian contingent had to deal with a peculiar situation where the prisoners of
war were not willing to go back to their respective countries. The CFI was commanded by Maj
Gen S P P Thorat and the contingent comprised of 5 RAJ RIF, 6 JAT, 3 DOGRA, and 3
GARHWAL along with the support units of 190 Infantry Brigade. They were deployed to take
charge of the prisoners of war (PsOW). The contingent had orders from the Indian government not
to be a party to any confrontation or to engage in force, coercion, and violence against PsOW.
Allowances were only made for minimum use of force but only for self-defense. The PsOW were
interned in camps set up by the Indian forces, and were often called ‘CHIKEN RUNS’ by the
American troops because of their resemblance to the chicken coops. Each of these enclosures were
under the oversight and protection of an Indian commander. However, the task of handling the
prisoners wasn’t a very easy one. The incidents of unrest and violence were frequently reported
due to the tense circumstances, but the Custodian Forces of India remained determined to
accomplish their duty to the best of their abilities and their management is still seen in a high
regard.
At one of the prison camps Sep Thakur Singh was on duty, as driver to the Deputy Commander,
Custodian Force. He was standing near the gate and he saw the General Officer, Commanding
Custodian force coming out of the camp with other senior officers after delivering a talk to the
prisoners. Major B. S. Grewal, 8 DOGRA, who was working as a Chinese Interpreter, was the last
to come out from the camp. Unfortunately, he was caught by a few rowdy prisoners and was
forcibly dragged into the camp full of agitated PsOW. Sep Thakur Singh rushed to rescue him with
complete disregard for his personal safety. The officer was being dragged from one tent to another
but Sep Thakur Singh remained committed to saving the officer and was with him throughout, thus
protecting him from serious injuries and facilitated his eventual rescue.

On the 25th September 1953, the prisoners of war, approximately 24,000 in number, became
truculent and started making rowdy demonstrations against the custodian Force, India. When the
General Officer Commanding Custodian force was coming out of the camp with other senior
officers after giving a talk to the prisoners, Major B. S. Grewal, 8 Dogra Regt., the Chinese
Interpreter who was the last to come out, was forcibly dragged into the camp by the prisoners.
Sepoy Thakur Singh, who was on duty as driver to the Deputy Commander, Custodian Force, and
was standing near the gate, saw the officer being dragged into the camp by the rowdy prisoners
and rushed to rescue him with complete disregard for his personal safety. The officer was being
dragged from one tent to another but Sepoy Thakur Singh remained with him throughout and thus
protected him from serious injury and facilitated his eventual rescue.
Sepoy Thakur Singh’s magnificent example of devotion to duty and personal bravery were
exemplary and reflected the highest tradition of the Army.

GAZETTE NOTIFICATION/ AUTHORITY
The UN Peacekeeping operation in Gaza was an attempt to resolve the 1956 Arab-Israel War.
The creation of United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) the first United Nations peacekeeping force,
represented a significant innovation within the United Nations. It was not a peace-enforcement
operation, as envisaged in Article 42 of the United Nations Charter, but a peacekeeping operation
to be carried out with the consent and the cooperation of the parties to the conflict. It was armed,
but the units were to use their weapons only in self-defense and even then, with utmost restraint.
Its main functions were to supervise the withdrawal of the British, French, and Israeli forces. After
the withdrawal was completed, UNEF’s responsibility was to act as buffer between the Egyptian and
Israeli forces to provide impartial supervision of the ceasefire.1 Two officers of Indian army,
Major General P S Gyani and Brigadier I J Rikhye, were force commanders for this UN Mission.
India was among the top contributors to the UNEF, from November 1956 to May 1967 and
eleven Indian infantry battalions served successively with this force.
On 10 April 1957, a platoon of the 3 PARA (KUMAON) [Now 3 PARA (SF)] was engaged in
clearing the minefields. Naik Puran Chand of 3 PARA (KUMAON) displayed devotion to his
duty and commendable courage while disarming several anti-tank and anti-personnel mines. He
was the No.2 in the first mine lifting party and while prodding for mines, he and Havildar Dewan
Singh got exposed to a massive mine explosion. An anti-personnel plastic mine exploded near
him and he suffered shrapnel wounds in many parts of his body. Despite being severely
wounded, Naik Puran Chand remained determined to complete his assigned task and continued
his attempts to defuse other mines. While he was engaged in completing the assigned task,
another mine exploded which led to the demise of both Naik Puran Chand and Havildar Dewan
Singh.

and camaraderie has made him an inspiration for many. For devotion towards duty and fortitude
that he displayed during the UN Peacekeeping mission Naik Puran Chand was awarded Ashoka
Chakra CL-III (now Shaurya Chakra) posthumously.","No. 4136122 Naik Puran Chand 3 Para Regt. (Kumaon) (Posthumous) (10th April, 1957)
On 10th April 1957, while serving with the United Nations Emergency Force in Sinai and Gaza
Strip, Nk Puran Chand who was No. 2 of the first mine lifting party had accounted for many
plastic anti tank mines and anti personnel mines with great courage. While he was prodding for
mines along with Hav Dewan Singh, an anti personnel mine went off very near him and he
received shrapnel wounds in many parts of his body. In Spite of his wounds, Nk Puran Chand
continued with his work to prevent sympathetic detonations. While so engaged, another mine
exploded resulting in the death of both himself and Hav Dewan Singh.
During these dangerous operations of mine clearing he had neutralised several anti-tank mines
that needed skilled engineering experience. Naik Puran Chand by his supreme sacrifice in the
cause of his duty has set a fine example of personal courage which is in the best traditions of our
Army.

born on 15 November 1928. He enrolled into the Dogra Regiment of the Indian Army at the age
of 18 on 15 May 1945.
The Dogra Regiment, raised in 1877 is one of the older infantry regiments of the Indian Army.
The regiment traces its roots directly from the 17th Dogra Regiment of the British Indian Army.
After World War I, the British Indian government restructured the army, moving from regiments
with a single battalion to multi battalion regiments. In 1945, it shed the numeral ‘17’ and became
Dogra Regiment. The Dogra Regiment has troops from Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir
and the Northern districts of Punjab. Their regimental war cry is “Jwala Mata Ki Jai” (Victory to
Goddess Jwala). The Dogras have participated in all the wars and conflicts fought by the Indian
Army since independence and winning laurels. 1 DOGRA also served as a part of the Indian
contingent at ONUC under 99 Infantry Brigade in 1961-63.
The United Nations Operation in the Congo was established on 14 July 1960 by the Security
Council Resolution 143 and dissolved on 30 June 1964. The initial mandate of ONUC was to
ensure the withdrawal of Belgian forces from the Republic of the Congo, assist the Government
in maintaining law and order and provide technical assistance. Subsequently, ONUC became
embroiled by the force of circumstances in a chaotic internal situation of extreme complexity and
had to be converted to use of military force. ONUC was to protect the Congo from outside
interference, particularly by evacuating foreign mercenaries and advisers from Katanga and
preventing clashes and civil strife, by force, if necessary, as a last resort. In 1961-62 secessionist
gendarmes under the command of foreign mercenaries clashed with the United Nations Force. At
its peak, the ONUC had 20,000 troops including a brigade from India. In February 1963, after
Katanga had been reintegrated into the national territory of the Congo, ONUC began to be phased
out.
During a United Nations Peacekeeping mission in Congo (1960-1963), Nk Ram Singh was
commanding a section of 1 DOGRA, located at Niemba in Katanga, Congo. On 17 July 1961,
Number 5 Platoon was unexpectedly attacked while holding a detached post. Nk Ram Singh's
section, part of Number 6 Platoon, was sent to reinforce Number 5 Platoon, about 1000 yards
away. On reaching the location, Number 6 platoon was ordered to clear the Katangese troops from
their positions. Nk Ram Singh fearlessly rushed with his section and cleared the first line of houses.
Further, his platoon was held up by heavy fire from a dug-in light machine gun (LMG) post, about
20 yards from the house they had just cleared. They tried to silence the post from their position by
throwing grenades but to no avail. At last, under cover of supporting fire from his own bren gun,
Nk Ram Singh crawled up to the Katangese LMG post and silenced it by tossing a grenade intothe trench, killing all three occupants. With the destruction of this post, the Katangese resistance
broke down.
Throughout this action, Nk Ram Singh displayed outstanding qualities of leadership in keeping
with the highest tradition of our army. He was awarded Vir Chakra on 26 January 1963 for
exemplary courage and determined leadership in the face of the enemy.","No. 3928961 PA/Nk Ram Singh, 1 Bn. Dogra Regiment.

hours on 17th July 1961, when No. 5 Platoon holding a detached post about 1000 yards away, was
unexpectedly attacked by Katanga troops, his section went with No. 6 Platoon to their aid. The
Katanga Army post continued to fire at both the platoons. No. 6 Platoon there upon was ordered
to clear the Katanga troops from their positions. Naik Ram Singh with great gallantry rushed with
his section and cleared the first line of houses. Further advance of his section was held up by heavy
fire from a dug-in LMG post, about 20 yards from the house they had just cleared. Attempts to
silence this post by throwing grenades from these houses proved futile. Under cover of supporting
fire from his own Bren gun, Nk Ram Singh crawled up to the Katangese LMG post and silenced
it by lobbing a grenade into the trench, killing all the three occupants. With the destruction of this
LMG post, the Katangese resistance broke down. Throughout this action, Nk Ram Singh
showcased outstanding qualities of leadership in keeping with the highest tradition of our Army.

completed his schooling and medical education from Swarajya High School, Srivaikuntam and
Stanley Medical College & Stanley Hospital, Chennai respectively. Following this, he was
commissioned into the Army Medical Corps of the Indian Army on 17 May 1960. During the
Sino India War of 1962, Captain Raja Amirthalingam was posted in the Ladakh Sector, where
he was rendering first aid to his comrades till the Post was overrun by the Chinese.
The Army Medical Corps (AMC) in India boasts a legacy deeply rooted in the nation's military
history, evolving to meet the dynamic challenges of healthcare in the context of armed forces.
Established on 01 January 1764, the Bengal Presidency Medical Service, which was the first
military service of the three Presidencies in India. The Indian Army Medical Corps came into
existence as a homogeneous corps of officers and men on the pattern of the Royal Army
Medical Corps on 03 April 1943 by the amalgamation of the Indian Medical Service (IMS),
the Indian Medical Department (IMD) and the Indian Hospital & Nursing Corps. It was
renamed as Army Medical Corps after the Independence. The Corps was formed as a wartime
necessity for attracting suitably qualified men for service in a rapidly expanding army.1 The
Army Medical Corps has been a part of all combat and active operations that Indian Army was
involved in. It has excelled in providing both peace time and combat health care to the defence
forces, medical services to UN peace keeping forces in foreign missions and during disaster
management to civil authorities.2 The Corps has the motto of “Sarve Santu Niramaya” meaning
“Let all be free from disease and disability”.
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after
its establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant
diplomatic status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state
recognition of PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into
negotiations with China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement
in 1954. Within a few weeks of Chou Enlai’s visit to India in 1954, the Chinese launched a
protest against the presence of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometers south of a border
pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the first time, the Government of China laid claim
to any part of Indian territory formally. The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957
marked a turning point in the Sino-India relations as the Chinese occupied a large part of the
Aksai Chin. This opened an opportunity for China to come out with territorial claims against
India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved in further into Ladakh and established

3 History of the Conflict with China, 1962. P.B Sinha. Col A.A. Athale (1992). History Division, Ministry of Defence,
Government of India.The fighting in Ladakh during the 1962 War was in three distinct phases. The first Phase began
on 19 October night when Chinese commenced their attacks against the isolated 'Forward
Policy’ Posts. This Phase lasted till 27 October. Between this time and 18 November there was
‘lull’ in fighting. This period was utilized by both sides to build up their strength, while the
Chinese build up was mainly opposite Spangur Gap, the Indian side strengthened defences in
depth. In the third and final phase the Chinese overwhelmed the Indian defences on the Eastern
edge of Chushul airfield. On declaration of Cease-Fire on 21 November 1962, the Chinese had
rendered the airfield unusable for use.
In this Sector, the peculiar geography of Ladakh made it doubly difficult for the soldiers as the
struggle was not just with the enemy but also with the high-altitude terrain. In September 1962,
Ladakh was defended by 114 Brigade consisting of 5 JAT, 1/8 GORKHA RIFLES, 7 and 14
JAMMU & KASHMIR MILITIA located at Leh. 14 J&K MILITIA with a company of 5 JAT
was in Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) sector. The remaining elements of 5 JAT were in
Changchenmo Sector, 1/8 GORKHA RIFLES was in Chushul with 7 J&K MILITIA at the
Indus Valley Sector. The Indus Valley Sector lies south of Chushul. Dungti was an important
location from where a road went North to Chusul, west to Leh and South along the Indus to
Demchok. The Indus River valley South of Dungati is a flat open area flanked by low hills on
the East. The international boundary followed the Eastern hills. These hills had several passes
opening to Tibetan plateau. Vehicular movement along presented no problems and excellent
airfield existed at Fukche. The road communications on the Chinese side were not well
developed and the only approach was from the South. The Chinese were estimated to have had
a battalion located in Tashigong.
Daulat Beg Oldi (DBO) was a vitally important Post since four tracks radiated from it. The old
Silk Route went North, crossed the Karakoram Pass (5575 meters) and went on to Yarkand in
Sinkiang. The other two routes connected DBO to Leh, over 200 kilometres away, and
requiring at least twelve days of long and difficult marching to reach it. Th Eastern or Winter
route went due South from DB0 crossing the Track Junction, Chip Chap River and the Depsang
Plains to reach the Murgo Post. 14 J&K Militia (now LADHAK SCOUTS) was responsible to
defend the DBO area and a Company of 5 JAT was deployed alongside. On 17 October 1962,
reports of heavy Chinese concentration opposite our Post Chandani started coming in. This
concentration of Chinese was so heavy that it posed a threat to entire area of Chip Chap and
Kara Koram.
DBO itself had the Battalion Headquarters and nearly a Company strength. The rest of the
available force was distributed on two possible approached. Chip Chap River valley had a total
of ten Posts. Chip Chap Posts 1 to 4 were located North of the river Chip Chap, while Posts 5
to 10 were to the South. Posts 10 to 14 guarded the approach from an uncharted river valley
further South. In addition, there were some troops in Murgo, Sultan Chushku, Track Junction,and all the way down to Shyok village, to provide Staging Posts for supply as well as the
columns that regularly moved between the main base at Leh and DBO. Out of these twenty-
one Posts, DBO had a Company strength and also Posts 1 and 4 on the North of Chip Chap
River had a Platoon each (roughly 25 to 30 men). Posts 5, 7 and 14 also had Platoon each. Rest
of the Posts had Section strength (between 10 to 15). These Posts were dependent upon DBO
for their supply. All the Posts were equipped only with small arms with the exception of Post
1 that had a Section of 3-inch mortars. The Posts thus were not in a position to dominate more
than 500 meters distance around them, this being the effective range of the Light Machine
Guns. average distance between the Posts was 2 to 3 kms and some like Post 14 were nearly
10 to 12 kms away from nearest Indian Posts. There was thus no possibility of mutual support.
The Chinese had been building up their strength In the Sector from July 1962 onwards. The
vicinity of Indian Post No 4 enabled them to bring in their heavy weapons very close to our
posts. On 19 October 1962, all the Indian Posts near Chip Chap were dominated by the Chinese
in superior strength. On 20 October at 0600 hours Chinese commenced shelling Post 1. The
bombardment continued for nearly one hour. After this the Post was attacked by the Chinese,
the Commander at DBO attempted to send reinforcements to it, but the Chinese, who had by
then occupied Post 5, which effectively dominated the route, made it impossible.
When Chinese heavily attacked in the night of 19/20 October 1962, Captain Raja
Amirthalingam was Medical Officer at Chandani Post in Ladakh. The Post had suffered many
casualties. Disregarding his personal safety, Captain Raja Amirthalingam moved from trench
to trench collecting the wounded and rendering first aid to them till the Post was overrun by an
overwhelming, number of Chinese attackers and went missing in action.
Throughout the action, Captain Raja Amirthalingam showed great courage and devotion to
duty in complete disregard to his own safety. He was awarded Vir Chakra posthumously.","Captain Raja Amirthalingam (MS-6497), Army Medical Corps (Missing)

The Ladakh Scouts known as the “Snow Warriors” were initially raised as a Paramilitary Force
formed of Ladakhi locals known as Nubra Guards to save Ladakh from intruders in 1948. It
comprised of Ladakhi locals who are physically fit and attuned with the rugged terrain and
hostile climate. The Ladakh Scouts was raised in 1963, following the Indo China War of 1962. It
had two Wings- the Karakoram Wing, defending the Eastern front facing China and the Indus
Wing facing Pakistan. The Regiment currently consists of five battalions. The Ladakh Scouts had
fought in the 1965 and 1971 India Pakistan War and were also part of Operation Meghdoot in
1984. Ladakh Scouts was converted into a Regiment in the year 2000. The Ladakh Scouts played
a significant role during the Kargil War of 1999 by marking one of the earliest victories and also

Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China since both the countries
shared political, geographical and cultural similarities. Therefore, soon after its establishment on
01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant diplomatic status to the
People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state recognition of PRC on
various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into negotiations with China on
the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement in 1954. Within a few weeks of
Chou Enlai’s visit to India, the Chinese launched a protest against the presence of Indian troops
in Barahoti, three kilometers South of a border pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the
first time, the Government of China laid claim to any part of Indian territory formally. The
construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957, marked a turning point in the Sino-India
relations as the Chinese occupied a large part of the Aksai Plateau. This opened an opportunity
for China to come out with territorial claims against India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers
moved in further into Ladakh and established themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal,
just South of Dambu Guru. On 08 September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the
Dhola Post in the Eastern Sector and began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in
NEFA in Namku Chu Sector as well as in Ladakh. The overwhelming number of the Chinese

The Chinese offensive in this Sector commenced with simultaneous attack on Posts No. 5 and 9
on 19 October 1962 at 2300 hrs. Post 5 (Pramodak) was manned by fourteen Jawans under an
NCO of 14 J&K Militia. Post 9 (Bhishan) was held by five Jawans of 5 JAT. The Chinese
subjected both the Posts to heavy fire from Mortars and Medium Machine Guns. Both theweapons having longer ranges than what the Indians had, the Chinese could remain out of range
of Indian: fire. The Indian defences were merely open trenches and Sangars (stone heaps above
ground level) as digging into the frozen soil was difficult and there was no stores for construction
of overhead cover to protect the Jawans from the splinter effects of the Mortar and Artillery
bombardment. Both the Posts were: constantly in touch with the Commander at DBO, Major
Shardul Singh Randhawa. It is estimated that the Chinese attacked Post 5 with nearly two
Companies and Post 9 with a Company. The Posts continued to resist the Chinese till first light
on 20 October, when both the Posts went out of communications with the Headquarters. There
were very few survivors. The Chinese occupied Post 5 and blocked the withdrawal and supply
routes of other posts deployed to the South East.
Havildar Tulsi Ram was the Commander of a small Post, near Post 5 and Post 9 in DBO Sector
of Northern Ladakh. He had only four militia men with him. On 19 October 1962, when the Post
was attacked by the Chinese, these five men held the enemy forces at bay and inflicted
approximately 200 casualties on them. Havildar Tulsi Ram himself manned the LMG
throughout, bringing it back with him after the Post fell. The courage displayed by him was of a
high order. He was awarded Vir Chakra for the display of exemplary leadership and conspicuous
courage in the face of enemy.
In the battles of Daulat Beg Oldi Sub Sector, Indian troops fought valiantly despite having
scarcity of resources and being outnumbered by the Chinese troops. In the fight of Post 1
(Chandani) or Post 4, Subedar Sonam Stopdan and Havildar Sarup Singh of the 14 J&K Militia
at Post 9 and 5 made the supreme sacrifice after taking heavy toll of the enemy. Both were
honored with the nation's second highest gallantry award, the Maha Vir Chakra. Major Sardul
Singh Randhawa was also decorated with the MVC for his inspiring leadership, courage,
commitment, steadfastness and the manner in which he organized the retreat in the DBO Sub-

DBO itself had the Battalion Headquarters and nearly a Company strength. The rest of the available
force was distributed on two possible approached. Chip Chap River valley had a total of ten Posts.
Chip Chap Posts 1 to 4 were located North of the river Chip Chap, while Posts 5 to 10 were to the

effective range of the Light Machine Guns. average distance between the Posts was 2 to 3 kms and
some like Post 14 were nearly 10 to 12 kms away from nearest Indian Posts. There was thus no
possibility of mutual support.
The Chinese had been building up their strength In the Sector from July 1962 onwards. The vicinity
of Indian Post No 4 enabled them to bring in their heavy weapons very close to our posts. On 19
October 1962, all the Indian Posts near Chip Chap were dominated by the Chinese in superior
strength.

Around 0230 hours on 20 October, the Chinese brought pressure against Posts 2 and 3 manned by,
5 JAT located on the Northern bank of Chip Chap River and the personnel of these two Posts were
asked to fall back on Post 4. Post 1 (Chandani) manned by a Platoon of 14 J&K Militia, was nowisolated. This Post was well sited on high ground and was not easy to assault. On 20 October at
0600 hours Chinese commenced shelling Post 1. The bombardment continued for nearly one hour.
After this the post was attacked by the Chinese, the Commander at DBO attempted to send
reinforcements to it, but the Chinese, who had by then occupied Post 5, which effectively
dominated the route, made it impossible.
On 20 October 1962, when our Post 1 (Chandni) in Ladakh was attacked by the Chinese, Sepoy
Sonam Wangchuk was posted at Chandni in Ladakh when his Post was attacked by the Chinese
and he was severely wounded in the attack. However, he remained at his Post with great courage
and determination and kept on fighting till the time he was overpowered and killed by the enemy.
The valour and courage of Sepoy Sonam Wangchuk in the face of the enemy was in the highest
traditions of the Indian Army.
In the battles of Daulat Beg Oldi Sub Sector, Indian troops fought valiantly despite having scarcity
of resources and being outnumbered by the Chinese troops. In the fight of Post 1 (Chandani) or
Post 4, Subedar Sonam Stopdan and Havildar Saroop Singh of the 14 J&K Militia made the
supreme sacrifice after taking heavy toll of the enemy. Both were honored with the nation's second
highest gallantry award, the Maha Vir Chakra. Major Sardul Singh Randhawa was decorated with

GAZETTE NOTIFICATION/ AUTHORITY
Captain Pradeep Bhatia was commissioned into 5 MAHAR and was deployed in the United
Nations Mission in Somalia (UNOSOM-II) in 1993. The Mahar regiment has a long and
proud tradition of bearing arms. Although the regiment was initially intended to comprise of
members from the Mahar community, today it is one of the most diverse regiments in the
Indian Army. In the 19th century, they were recruited by the British East India Company and
were part of the Company’s Bombay Army. However, with the introduction of the ‘class
regiments’ policy after the First War of Independence in 1857, the British government
demobilised the Mahar troops. When the First World War broke out in 1914, the British
government was forced to expand its recruiting policies and a Mahar battalion was raised in
1917. After the war ended, the battalion was disbanded again in March 1921. In 1941, when
Dr BR Ambedkar was appointed to the Viceroy’s Executive Council, he exerted pressure on
the British government to enlist the Mahar troops into the army. In October 1941, the 1
MAHAR was raised in Belgaum, thus establishing the origin of the present-day Mahar
Regiment. Between the two wars, the demand to raise Mahar regiment was constantly raised.
The United Nations (UN) launched two missions in Somalia to address the inter-clan conflict
that had continued for decades. Somalia (then Somaliland) was under the colonial rule of
Britain and Italy. On 1 July 1960, the two divisions of Somalia were merged together to form
the Somalia Republic. Soon after independence it descended into inter-clan conflict and the
country was in shambles. The UN volunteers were working in Somalia providing
humanitarian aid, even before the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 733
(1992) was passed. This resolution urged the concerned parties in Somalia to end all
hostilities promote reconciliation and facilitate delivery of humanitarian assistance. On 24
April 1992, under UNSC Resolution 751 (1992), the first UN Operation in Somalia
(UNOSOM-I) was launched. During UNOSOM-I, an Indian Naval Task Force was deployed
to aid the United States of America (USA) led United Task Force (UNITAF). However, due
to the persistent attack from the armed rebels, on 26 March 1993, UNSC Resolution 814
(1993) was passed establishing UNOSOM-II. Under this resolution, immediate deployment
of forces to end all violence was made, primarily focusing on disarmament of armed groups
and rebuilding the Somalia society among others.
2In March 1994, Captain Pradeep Bhatia of 5 MAHAR was in command of a platoon strength
escort party, accompanying a logistics convoy of two Irish Army Transport Companies from
Mogadishu to Baidoa. The convoy was ambushed by the militiamen. Captain Bhatia
manoeuvred, as per the pre-rehearsed drill, with an aim to reduce the pressure on the leading
party. The plan was successful as he coordinated with the medium machine gun (MMG)
gunner while he leaned out of a speeding Nissan to accurately fire on the militiamen.
On closing with the militia ambush, he jumped out of his vehicle and immediately charged at
a heavy machine gun (HMG) killing the main gunner with his AK-47. When the second
gunner tried to attack, the officer struck him with the butt of his weapon. In the encounter, 15
militiamen were killed and 20 captured and a large quantity of arms and ammunitions were
recovered.
Captain Pradeep Bhatia fought valiantly and in recognition of his bravery and courage under
fire, he was awarded with Shaurya Chakra on 15 March 1994.","Captain Pradeep Bhatia (IC-43872), Mahar
(Effective date of award: 15 March 1994)
On March 1994, Captain Pradeep Bhatia was detailed as in charge of platoon strength escort
party accompanying number 2 Irish Army transport company’s logistic convoy in Somalia.
The convoy was on its way from Mogadishu to Baidoa, a distance of about 250 kilometers,
when it was ambushed by a large party of Somali militiamen. Following the pre-rehearsed
drills, the leading vehicle party assaulted the militia positions on the South. Captain Bhatia
moved from the right and tried to assault with an aim to ease pressure on the leading party on
the south. The plan succeeded with the full volley of militia fire directed at Capt. Bhatia’s
party. He asked his MMG gunner to keep them pinned down and himself brought down
accurate fire buy leaning out of the window of the speeding Nissan in which his party was
mounted.
As soon as he closed in, he jumped out of the vehicle and charged at the heavy machine gun
(HMG) killing the main gunner with his AK-47 rifle. When second gunner tried to replace
the dead gunner, Captain Bhatia pounced on him and struck him unconscious with the butt of
his weapon. However, he himself came under intense fire. But he assaulted, killing one
militiaman and injuring one more with fire from his weapon. This relentless assault led by
Capt. Bhatia on the militia ambush finally succeeded with the militia beating a hasty retreat
3into the jungle. In the encounter, 15 militiamen were killed and 20 captured and a large
number of arms and ammunitions were recovered.
Captain Pradeep Bhatia, thus, displayed bravery, courage and devotion to duty in his fight
against the Somali militiamen.

and Smt Soma Devi Nayyar, in Hoshiarpur District of Punjab. He did his schooling from D A
V Higher Secondary School in Hoshiarpur and later graduated from the Desh Bandhu Gupta
College, New Delhi. He was a bright student who consistently performed well in academics
and sports. Subsequently, Second Lieutenant Hardev Pal got selected to join the Army and
went to the Officers' Training Academy (OTA) Chennai. He was commissioned into 8 SIKH
LI of the Sikh Light Infantry on 06 September 1970. After completing his training, very early
in his service career, he got involved in the thick of operations as border tension arose with
Pakistan in 1971.
The Sikh Light Infantry previously known as the Mazabhi and Ramdasia Sikh Regiment is a
Regiment of the Indian Army. Its name was changed to the Sikh Light Infantry in 1944. The
Sikh Light Infantry inherited the battle honours, colours and traditions of the Mazabhi Sikh
Pioneers on its merging with a few Ramdasia Companies in 1941. After serving under the
British Raj for nearly a century they distinguished themselves with loyalty to the British
Crown and Empire in numerous conflicts in and around the Indian Subcontinent including
both the First World War and the Second World War. The Sikh Light Infantry has displayed
immense versatility as the regiment conducted operations from Siachen Glacier to
counterterrorism. The regimental motto is Deg Tegh Fateh, meaning prosperity in peace and
victory in war. During the Indo-Pak War of 1971, 8 SIKH LI was awarded the Battle Honour
“Fatehpur” for displaying exemplary courage and fortitude. The Regiment has given the
Indian Army three Chiefs - General Ved Prakash Malik PVSM, AVSM who was the 19th
Army Chief, General Bikram Singh PVSM, UYSM, AVSM, SM, VSM, who was the 24th
Army Chief and General Manoj Mukund Naravane PVSM, AVSM, SM, VSM, who was the
28th Army Chief and retired on 30th April 2022.
The 1971 War was a military conflict between India and Pakistan during the Bangladesh
Liberation War from 03 to 16 December 1971. It began with preemptive airstrikes by the
Pakistan Air Force on Indian targets, leading to India’s involvement in support of Bengali
nationalist forces. Pakistan suffered a significant defeat in this War. The Indo-Pak War of
1971 was the first war when the Indian Government engaged all three services on a large
scale. A total of 4,090 Indian soldiers made the supreme sacrifice during this war and about
600 officers and men of the Indian Armed Forces were decorated with Gallantry awards. Of
these, 04 were Param Vir Chakra, 76 Maha Vir Chakra and 513 Vir Chakra.Battle of Fatehpur

The Punjab Sector, which included Punjab, Haryana and the Ganganagar District of Rajasthan
was the responsibility of the XI Corps commanded by Lieutenant General NC Rawlley,
PVSM, AVSM, MC under the overall command of Lieutenant General KP Candeth, PVSM
GOC-in-C, Western Command. The area of responsibility of the XI Corps thus extended over
640 km along the international border. Its Main HQ was at Amritsar from where it controlledthe Northern half of the Sector. The Corps consisted of three independent Sectors. It had
assigned the following defended Sectors to its formations: Amritsar to 15 Infantry Division,
Ferozepur to 7 Infantry Division and Ganga Nagar to Foxtrot Sector now 16 Infantry
Division.
15 Infantry Division under Major General BM Bhattacharjea, MVC was to defend the
Amritsar Sector, including the prominent towns of Amritsar, Dera Baba Nanak and Ajnala. Its
Brigades were deployed as follows:
86 Infantry Brigade in Dera Baba Nanak area.
58 Infantry Brigade in Ajnala area.
96 Infantry Brigade in Fatehpur-Burj area.
54 Infantry Brigade in Atari-Ranian area.
38 Infantry Brigade in Neshta-Rajatal area.
96 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier AE Joseph was given the responsibility of
defending the area between Chann Malla and Bhindi Aulakh in the North-West of Amritsar.
Across the Ravi, Pakistan had a sizeable enclave at Fatehpur and Bhago-Kamo and it could
establish a Bridgehead there and pose a threat to Amritsar. The Indian Army, therefore,
decided to capture the enclave.
On the night of 03/04 December 1971 Pakistan inducted the major part of their 88 Infantry
Brigade belonging to 17 Infantry Division into this Enclave and under pressure from this
force the Border Security Force was forced to vacate Ghoge, Behlol, Gulgarh, Burj and
Fatehpur Posts. The Border Security Force, thus withdrawn, were re-deployed further back at
Vara and the defences there were strengthened by the induction of two Platoons of 15
MARATHA LI and one Troop of 66 Armoured Regiment equipped with Vijayantha tanks
with orders that there would be no further withdrawal.
Orders were then issued to 15 MARATHA LI to attack Tur and Burj and a Troop of tanks
were placed under command for the attack. Before the attack could be launched a Company
of 43 Baluch attacked Bhindi Aulak from Tur. The plan had therefore to be altered: to first
contain the Pakistani attack. The attack was beaten back by Indian Artillery and armour and
the attackers fled leaving behind their dead and some arms and ammunitions.
The attack was finally put in by Major Ranbir Singh, the Second-in-Command of 15
MARATHA LI, with two Companies, on 06 December 1971. The enemy taking shelter in
bunkers bought down heavy fire on the assaulting troops. A close fight ensued. The Marathas
fought their way doggedly from bunker to bunker physically. In many cases the enemy was
dispossessed of his weapons forcibly. The Marathas recaptured Burj and paved the way for
the success of 96 Infantry Brigade.
The Brigade Commander, Brigadier A E Joseph, then decided to put an end to the threat by
capturing Pakistan's Fatehpur Post by using 8 SIKH LI for the purpose.
The plan of 8 SIKH LI, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel H C Pathak, was first to capture
the Dussi Bund up to Fatehpur Post with two Companies by the midnight of 11/12 Decemberand then to push through the third Company to capture Dussi Bund Junction by 0100 hours on
12 December 1971 and after that to capture an area known as Twin Huts by another Rifle
Company by 0230 hours on 12 December 1971.
On 11 December, Lieutenant Colonel Pathak gave his orders for a night attack to capture
Fatehpur and regain the lost portion of Dussi Bund. The enemy positions were heavily
defended and fortified, laid out with well-connected trenches and bunkers, mortars and anti-
tank guns that formed a strong line of defense to be broken. Yet, determined to capture his
objective, Lieutenant Colonel Pathak decided to push on with the attack. He himself led the
charge, followed by his Rifle Companies.
The operation commenced with a seven-minute bombardment of the objective after which at
2300 hours on 11 December 1971 'B' and 'C' Companies crossed their start line moving on
either side of the Dussi Bund with the Troops of 66 Armoured Regiment providing support by
direct fire. The enemy Machine-Guns opened up from their bunkers, but 'B' Company under
Major Ravi Kumar silenced them by lobbing grenades into them. Unmindful of enemy
shelling 'B' Company pressed on and captured their first objective. Second Lieutenant Hardev
Pal was functioning as a Platoon Commander in the Company, which was assigned the task of
attacking the enemy Post. During the assault, his Platoon was held up by automatic fire from
the enemy bunkers. Second Lieutenant Hardev Pal realized that the bunkers needed to be
neutralized at any cost to facilitate the advance of his Platoon. With complete disregard for his
personal safety, he crawled up to two bunkers and silenced them with grenades. While
assaulting the third bunker, Second Lieutenant Hardev Pal was hit by a burst of MMG fire.
Though seriously wounded, he kept on encouraging his men till the Post was captured. He
eventually succumbed to his injuries. The Battalion had achieved its objective and hoisted the
tri-colour proudly at the captured Fatehpur Post by 0100 hours on 12 September after a fierce
battle. The enemy counter-attacked but Captain Rajan, the FOO, brought down such accurate
fire on the attacking troops that the counterattack broke up.
C Company made slow progress. Lieutenant Colonel Pathak came forward with his
Intelligence Officer, Second Lieutenant Rai to see for himself what was really amiss. The
Colonel’s presence acted as a further stimulus for the C Company to press on. By 0015
hours, the Company captured its objective. was then pushed through and after some heavy
fighting captured their objective BP 85.Brigadier AE Joseph with the officers of 8 SIKH LI

The second part of the plan was somewhat delayed as the enemy reacted violently and
counter-attacked again and again. The attack was finally put in at 0115 hours on 12 December
and 'A' Company, after heavy fighting, captured their objective by 0200 hours. During this
attack Captain Karan Singh who was leading the attack showed exemplary courage and was
killed while leading his troops. The enemy immediately counter-attacked and a fierce battle
ensued.Battle of Fatehpur

While directing the artillery fire on the Bund junction, Major Tirath Singh was killed. His
bravery and devotion to duty earned him a Sena Medal posthumously. During this action,
Lieutenant Colonel Pathak moved from one locality to another despite heavy shelling and
small arms fire and encouraged his men to hold their ground and beat back the enemy attack
inflicting heavy casualties. ‘D' Company was then moved up to reinforce 'A' and 'B'
Companies while 'C' Company set about clearing the remaining part of Dussi Bund and the
whole area including Fatehpur post and Twin Huts was secured by the Battalion by 1400
hours on 12 December 1971.
The success of the Battalion was largely due to leadership, good planning and control by
Lieutenant Colonel Pathak - and the excellent coordination between Infantry, Armour and
Artillery and above all the gallantry shown by the men. Throughout the entirety of the battle,
Lieutenant Colonel Pathak, the Battalion Commanding Officer, personally engaged in combat
alongside his soldiers, demonstrating exemplary leadership by leading from the front lines.

The Indo-Pak War of 1971 was the first war when the Indian Government engaged all three
Services on a large scale. In the Western Sector, an important battle took place in the
Shakargarh area during the 1971 War. The Battle of Basantar, fought from 15 to 17 December
1971, emerged as one of the most intense tank battles of the conflict. Pakistan's strategy on the
Western Front during this war aimed to capture significant Indian territory to offset anticipated
losses on the Eastern Front. This strategy aimed to secure a stronger bargaining position forPakistan in post-war negotiations with India. India was concerned that Pakistan might launch an
attack opposite the Shakargarh Bulge, targeting Pathankot and the Jammu-Pathankot Road, to
achieve this objective.
The Battle of Basantar, many acts of courage were performed. Major Hoshiar Singh of 3
GRENADIERS and Second Lieutenant Arun Kheterpal of POONA HORSE were awarded the
Param Vir Chakra. While Lieutenant Colonel (later Lieutenant General) Hanut Singh and Major
Amarjit Singh Bal of POONA HORSE, Lieutenant Colonel (later Lieutenant General) RM
Vohra of HODSON’S, Lieutenant Colonel Ved Prakash Ghai and Horse Havildar Thomas
Philipose of 16 MADRAS, Lieutenant Colonel (later Lieutenant General) Ved Airy of 3
GRENADIERS and Major Vijay Rattan Choudhry of 9 Engineers Regiment were awarded the
Maha Vir Chakra. Brigadier (later General) Arun Vaidya was awarded a Bar to Maha Vir
Chakra for his bold leadership while commanding the 16 (Independent) Armoured Brigade at
Zafarwal and Basantar.
The Shakargarh Bulge, the area where Pakistan was likely to advance into India, is situated
between the Chenab and Ravi rivers. To the North, the Bulge runs parallel to the hills, with its
tip pointing towards the Madhopur Headworks and the Pathankot military base on the opposite
side. In the South, it borders the Ravi River, across which lie the Indian cities of Amritsar,
Batala, and Gurdaspur. Several nullahs, including Aik, Degh, Basantar, Bein, and Ujh, flow
generally from north to south through the area. A network of roads and rail tracks originating
from Sialkot, Gujranwala, and Lahore and running west to east towards Shakargarh connected
important communication centers such as Pasrur, Chawinda, Zafarwal, Dhamthal, and Narowal.
The terrain in the area was suitable for the use of armored vehicles.
I Corps commanded by Lieutenant General KK Singh, MVC was deployed by the third week of
October in the area as a defensive measure.
1 Corps offensive plan was as under: –
The firm bases and defences of the area were to be held by 168 Infantry Brigade ex 26 Infantry
Division, 323 Infantry Brigade and 87 Infantry Brigade ex 39 Infantry Division, and 18 Infantry
Brigade ex 36 Infantry Division. 62 Cavalry and one Armoured Squadron ex 14 Independent
Armoured Brigade was the armour allotted to the defensive forces at the scale of one squadron
per brigade.
36 Infantry Division under Major General BS Alhuwalia was without two of its Brigades. It had
only one Infantry Brigade 115 Infantry Brigade with only two Infantry Battalions. The Division
was not committed to battle till 12 December. Thereafter it was deployed along with 2
(Independent) Armoured Brigade for the Battle of Shakargarh.
39 Infantry Division under Major General BR Prabhu did not have any of its Brigades for the
operation. One of its Brigades had been sent to reinforce Poonch and the other two were
deployed for holding the firm base. For its operation 72 Infantry Brigade with four Infantry
Battalions, 2 (Independent) Armoured Brigade less one Armoured Regiment and 1 DOGRA
(Mechanised) were placed under its command along with an Artillery Brigade for fire support.The Division was given the task of advancing between Basantar and Karir Nadi and capturing
Dehlra – Chakra by D plus 2 and thereafter capture Shakargarh.
54 Infantry Division under Major General (later Lieutenant General) WAG Pinto comprised
three Infantry Brigades (47, 74, and 91 Infantry Brigades) and 16 (Independent) Armoured
Brigade, less 62 Cavalry, 18 RAJPUTANA RIFLES (Mechanised) less two Companies, 90
(Independent) Reece Squadron (AMX), and two Engineer Regiments. Additionally, the
Division had four Medium Regiments, in addition to the Divisional Artillery, for providing fire
support. The Division's task was to advance in the area between Degh Nadi and Karir Nadi,
capture Zaffarwal – Dhamtalline, and then prepare for the capture of Deoli and Mirzapur.
The offensive commenced on 05 December, with troops advancing on a broad front between
Degh Nadi and Basantar River as follows:
- 54 Infantry Division supported by 16 (Independent) Armoured Brigade (less one Regiment)
from the
general area Mawa-Galar;
- 39 Infantry Division and 72 Infantry Brigade (four battalions) of 36 Infantry Division
supported by 2 (independent) Armoured Brigade (less one Regiment) from the general
area Londi-Chak, Dolna-Mangu Chak.
Advance by 54 Infantry Division to Basantar
Operations of 54 Infantry Division also commenced simultaneously with those of 39 Infantry
Division. The border outposts were captured on the night of 05/06 December. The advance
commenced on 06 December. Pakistan had deployed one Squadron of their Reconnaissance
Regiment, 20 Lancers (Chaffee tanks) and one Squadron of the Divisional Armoured Regiment,
33 Cavalry (Pattons) along with Infantry as Covering Troops. Pakistani Air Force was also quite
active. 47 Infantry Brigade was ordered to advance and establish a Bridgehead in Thakurdwarh
– Bari – Darman area. 16 MADRAS was placed under the command of 47 Infantry Brigade.
16 MADRAS, led by Lieutenant Colonel Ved Prakash Ghai and supported by 4 HORSE,
initiated their attack at 0230 hours on 06 December 1971. Their advance was initially impeded
by enemy resistance at Bhaironath and Badala Gujran, where tank and Machine Gun fire
obstructed their progress. Despite this, 16 MADRAS pressed on with an assault, successfully
securing the positions by 0700 hours on 07 December. This operation resulted in the capture of
the first Pakistani Prisoner of War, a Chaffee tank, and a map detailing the layout of minefields
in the area.Advance of 47 Infantry Brigade

16 MADRAS continued their advance and encountered a deep minefield North of Thakurdwarh.
Taking a calculated risk, the minefield's trawling was carried out by 405 Field Company and the
trawls of 16 (Independent) Armoured Brigade in a dust haze before sunset. Two Centurion tanks
were positioned strategically on the home side of the minefield to provide covering fire, while
another Centurion tank followed the Trawl Tanks to offer close fire support. During the trawling
process, one of the tanks spotted three enemy tanks in hull-down position and engaged them.
One enemy tank was disabled, and the others withdrew. By 1830 hours, the trawling was
completed, and a Squadron of tanks was inducted into the Bridgehead. Impressively, 405 Field
Company breached a 500-meter-deep minefield, 5 meters wide, in just one hour. This was the
first time that trawls breached a minefield.
16 MADRAS proceeded to attack Thakurdwarh, with two Squadrons of 4 HORSE placed under
their command. The attack was launched, and despite a fierce struggle, the objective was
captured by 2230 hours on 06 December. During this action, they captured one enemy tank, two
Machine Guns, and a map case showing the alignment of minefields. By 0200 hours on 07December, 405 Field Company completed the breaching and marking of the minefield.
The next objective was Bari. Brigadier (later Major General) AP Bhardwaj, VSM the
Commander of 47 Infantry Brigade, which had moved up to Thakurdwarh, ordered 16
MADRAS to to probe Bari and capture it if possible. The Combat Group departed Thakurdwarh
at midnight and approached Bari from the West. By 0130 hours on 07 December, the tanks
encountered a nala and became bogged down. However, all but two tanks were extricated, and
the Combat Group launched an attack on Bari from the West. The enemy, taken by surprise,
fled, resulting in the capture of Bari before the first light of 07 December.
16 MADRAS then captured Dodwan Kalan on the night of 07/08 December, while 18
RAJPUTANA RIFLES took possession of Ghamrola on 08 December. However, as both the
flanks of the Division were now exposed, a decision was made to suspend the advance, till the
Eastern flank was secured.

The task allotted to 54 Infantry Division included the destruction of the Pakistan 8
(Independent) Armoured Brigade and the capture of Zafarwal. After capturing Lohara-Laisar,
Kalan-MehlwanLagwal it decided to establish a Bridgehead to the South-West of Basantar. 47
Infantry Brigade was ordered to establish the Bridgehead, in the area Barapind-Sikandarpur-
Lalial and SouthWest shoulder of the Supwal Ditch, while the 74 Infantry Brigade was ordered
to capture the remaining part of the Supwal Ditch. The Pakistanis had predictably concentrated
the bulk of their Armour to the West of the Basantar river in the area of the Supwal Ditch andZafarwal.
The terrain was devoid of roads and abounded in streams. The Pakistanis had sited obstacle
belts in considerable depth, and had covered them by infantry, RCL guns and tanks. Medium
Machine Guns and Infantry 'Nests' supported by automatics were positioned in between the
minefields. The positions were fortified with bunkers, connected by a network of
communication trenches and alternate positions. Gaps in Platoon localities and flanks were
covered by elements of Recce and Support Battalions. Formidable mine barriers, approximately
1460 metres deep, were laid.

The Indian Engineers breached the minefield with considerable effort and skill. They also
forged operational tracks in this dusty terrain and surfaced the roadways with elephant grass and
Chari. Other arms too were well integrated. Major VR Chowdhary of 9 Engineer Regiment did
a commendable job in clearing the mines but was killed in action while clearing a lane. He was
decorated with the Maha Vir Chakra posthumously while their Commanding Officer Lieutenant
Colonel (later Lieutenant General) BT Pandit was awarded the Vir Chakra. 54 Infantry Division
chose the Sarajchak-Lalial RF-Jarpal-Lohal to cross the Basantar River, while the enemy
expected it around Badwal.
The Commanding Officer 16 MADRAS Lieutenant Colonel Ghai, decided to carry out the
assigned task as under: Phase 1– Capture of Lalial RF and Sarajchak by C and D Companies;
Phase 2– Capture of 6r and 5r by A and B Companies.
The attack started at 1930 h on 15 December with C Company on the right under Major PVSahadevan was tasked to capture Lalial RF and D Company on the left under Major CBS
Krishnia for Sarajchak. Soon after leaving the FUP, the enemy started engaging own troops with
artillery fire. The MMGs from the enemy nests brought down menacing fire during the crossing
of the Basantar river. During each stage of the battle, he made good use of his alternative
positions.
On reaching the far side of the obstacle, C Company suffered very heavy casualties. Both the
leading Platoon Commanders were seriously wounded. It was only at this stage that the
Company Commander realised that the anticipated Pakistani defences based on Supwal Ditch
were extended so much towards the Lalial RF as against the information available earlier. At
least four MMGs including those from the concrete pill-boxes of Supwal Ditch opened up over
a frontage of 1000 yards almost arresting the progress of the attack. The Forward Observation
Officer was asked to direct artillery fire closer. Under its cover, the assaulting Platoons kept
inching forward just 50 yards behind the artillery barrage. When within 400 yards of the
objective, the enemy fire was so intense and accurate that move forward was almost stalled.
At this stage, the Company Commander, Major PV Sahadevan, maneuvered his No 8 Platoon
from the flank. Havildar Thomas Philipose, having taken over the Platoon, as the Platoon
Commander was wounded, led a fierce attack from the right (northern direction), and even after
being wounded twice did not stop till his Platoon had captured four bunkers.
He refused to be evacuated and kept on holding the area of the captured objective. For this
gallant action, Havildar Thomas Philipose was awarded the MVC.
During the final stages of the attack, the company faced intense enemy fire, wounding/killing a
number of his men - including 2 of the platoon commanders, which threatened to impede the
assault. Maj Sahadevan crawled up to the enemy bunker, lobbed a grenade, setting ablaze the
RCL Jeep, fuel, ammunition, resulting in a massive explosion, which silenced the adjoining
MMG. The brave action created the crucial breakthrough at the critical time. This created panic
in the enemy. Second Lieutenant PA Somaiah, leading No 9 Platoon, was closely following the
action of the Company Commander, and seeing an opportunity he cashed in on it by promptly
pressing home the charge. The effect of enemy fire having been reduced thus, C Company
pounced on the enemy with bayonets. Naik A Sahadevan rushed at the enemy MMG and
silenced it by a grenade, but received a burst in the chest and was killed he was awarded the
VrC posthumously. It took about an hour of severe hand to hand fighting to clear the entire
objective, and C Company gave the success signal at 2130 hours 15 December. The resolute
leadership of Sahadevan and the valour of his men prevailed as they engaged in a hand to hand
fight with their fixed bayonets to beat the enemy. The Company Commander, Major PV
Sahadevan, earned a VrC in this action. The Company in this engagement had accounted for 14
killed on the objective.COAS talking to Maj Sahadevan

D Company, assaulting on the left, ran into almost similar opposition. Hardly had they stormed
the forward bunkers, they were up against the fire from well-concealed positions in the built-up
area behind. Then onwards it turned an arduous battle of flushing the enemy out from one
position after the other. Krishnia, the Company Commander, went about it clinically, employing
one platoon at a time in flanking moves, exercising utmost fire discipline. It was slow going;
still they made it in fairly good time, and Sarajchak had been cleared by 2200 hours, just half an
hour behind the C Company at Lalial. A body count in the morning gave the enemy dead on the
objective as 15. Own losses were 11 killed and 27 wounded.
C Company, far too close to the Supwal Ditch for comfort of the enemy there, was by now
being targeted intensely by their guns. The Pakistanis, stunned by the ferocity of the assault,
soon gathered their wits and launched a blistering counter-attack about an hour before midnight.
They closed in employing a ruse of imitating shouts and cries of other Indian troops; but it
didn’t get them far as the company rallied to take them on. Thomas Philipose, still on his feet,
trumped his own exploit earlier by gathering his depleted platoon to lead a daring counter-
charge. Battered badly, the enemy fell back in confusion and then fled, leaving three of their
dead behind.
The A and B Companies then swiftly captured the twin feature 5r and 6r beyond Lalial and
Sarajchak. The Grenadiers also captured their objective during the night. The Poona Horse later
showed exemplary bravery, where Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal was the awarded the
Param Vir Chakra.The Battle of Basantar exemplified courage and determination, with the success of the battle
hinging on the troops' ability in the bridgehead to repel expected enemy counterattacks. The
preservation of the bridgehead can largely be attributed to the remarkable actions of 4 HORSE,
17 HORSE, 16 MADRAS, and 3 GRENADIERS and 9 Engineer Regiment. 17 HORSE notably
neutralized a significant portion of Pakistan's 8 Independent Armoured Brigade during the
battle. The timely breaching of the minefield by 9 Engineer Regiment facilitated the induction
of armor into the bridgehead. The Regiment of Artillery also played a crucial role in this
remarkable victory.

Major Patinhare Veetil Sahadevan (IC-22366), The Madras Regiment
(Effective date of award– 16th December 1971)
On the night of 15th/16th December 1971, Major Patinhare Veetil Sahadevan who was
commanding a company of a Battalion of the Madras Regiment was given the task of
establishing a bridge-head in an area in the Western Sector. This involved an attack across a
minefield of over 800 yards depth. During this assault, his company suffered casualties while in
the minefield. Major Sahadevan, with utter disregard for his safety, moved ahead and inspired
his men to follow him. On reaching the far end of the minefield the company encountered stiff
opposition. An enemy Medium Machine Gun firing from a bunker nearby was causing
casualties on our troops. Major Sahadevan immediately crawled upto the enemy bunker and
lobbed a grenade in it. This set ablaze fuel and ammunition in the bunker and the enemy started
fleeing in confusion. During the attack, he moved from trench to trench, unmindful of the heavy
shelling to encourage his men to hold their ground and repulse the attacks.
Throughout the action, Major Patinhare Veetil Sahadevan displayed gallantry, leadership and
devotion to duty of a high order.

93 Infantry Brigade being commanded by Brigadier AV Natu was responsible for the defence
of the Northern most Sector of 25 Infantry Division. The Poonch Sub Sector has one of the
most difficult terrain South of Pir Panjal Range. Brigadier Natu knew that it was extremely
essential for a Commander to know in detail the terrain in which his formation was deployed.

Infantry Brigade attacking the Durga, Banwat and Doda defences with the aim to capturePoonch. Throughout the night of 03 and 04 December, there was heavy shelling by enemy on
all forwardpicquets.

area Pakistan attacked twice. The first attack on the Langoor position overran the Listening

the attack, and drove the attackers out. The second attack was launched in the early hours of
04December,was alsorepulsedby0300hours.
BanwatSubsector
The Banwat Sector included a Hill Complex that dominated the Poonch town. The defence of
this Sector was necessary to protect the town from the East and North-East. Picquets 405,
which covered Tund and Helipad. This Picquets and Picquets 406 and 406A were considered
grounds of tactical importance and 6 SIKH was tasked to defend the area. To the South of 6
SIKH, 8 JAT were located. The Battalion was placed under the command of the 93 Infantry
Brigade togive depthtothe defences of6SIKH.
Pakistan was well prepared to attack the Indian Brigade from the north-eastern side. Chand
Tekri and Munawari Tekri, nicknamed Raja and Rani, were two vital positions held by
Pakistanis in the area. 6 SIKH had anticipated an attack because of the Pakistani build up and
the development of a road from Kahuta to Rani Picquets. Therefore, it had taken necessary
measures to give depth to the defences. As expected, the Pakistanis launched an attack on
Helipad and Tund on the night of 03/04 December, with three battalions. The Helipad fell to
Pakistani troops at 1030 hours. In the view of mounting threat, two platoons of 8 JAT were

Captain Rathi was functioning as Adjutant of his Battalion at that time and understood the
gravity of the situation. He quickly analysed the situation and concluded that the advancing
enemy had to stopped at any cost. Captain Rathi along with his handful of men decided to
assault the enemy troops on the flank and succeed in foiling the enemy attack. The enemy
surprised and upset by Captain Rathi's assault decided to reorganize and attack again. Theenemy reorganized for a fresh attack and brought down heavy artillery fire on the Indian
position. Undeterred by the ferocity of the enemy attack, Captain Rathi moved from trench to
trench inspiring his men to repulse the attack. However, during this process, he was hit by an
enemy artillery shell and got seriously injured. He later succumbed to his injuries on 07

IC-18086,Major,Narain Singh,4 JAT,"Major Narain Singh was born on 19 August, 1936, to Shri Kartar Singh and Smt Dhan Devi, in
Krimachi-Mansar Village, in Udhampur District of Jammu & Kashmir. He was the eldest son of
the family and was lovingly called Kaku. He completed his primary education from Krimachi,
middle school from Udhampur and joined Army Boys Company from where began his career in
Army. He was commissioned on 30 June, 1963 into 4 JAT of the Jat Regiment, an Infantry
Regiment well known for its intrepid soldiers. During the 1965 Indo-Pak war he was sent on
deputation to Assam Rifles and was posted in North-East. After serving for a few years he got
married to Ms Urmila Bhatiyal, a daughter of another Army family on 09 February 1966. The
couple was blessed with a son Narinder in 1968.
The 1971 War was a military conflict between India and Pakistan during the Bangladesh
Liberation War from 03 to 16 December 1971. It began with preemptive airstrikes by the
Pakistan Air Force on Indian targets, leading to India’s involvement in support of Bengali
nationalist forces. Pakistan suffered a significant defeat in this War. The Indo-Pak War of 1971
was the first war when the Indian Government engaged all three services on a large scale. A total
of 4,090 Indian soldiers made the supreme sacrifice during this war and about 600 officers and
men of the Indian Armed Forces were decorated with Gallantry awards. Of these, 04 were Param
Vir Chakra, 76 Maha Vir Chakra and 513 Vir Chakra.
India had anticipated that Pakistan could attack Fazilka through the Enclaves, located to the south
of river Satluj. An attack was also expected from the North, through Jalalabad or from the
Sulaimanke Bridgehead in the West. There was also an assessment that Pakistan would try to
lean against the defences on the Sabuna Distributary. After the Indo-Pak War 1965, India had
constructed an anti-tank obstacle in the shape of the Sabuna Distributary, about 10 to 13 km from
the town of Fazilka, which covered all the approaches. The alignment of the Distributary was
parallel to the International Boundary, covered 22 kms from the Gang Canal to Fazilka Creek,
and provided for many fortifications. The Salem Shah Nala, just North of the Fazilka town
constituted a hurdle, while the Chandbhan drain, 13 km North of Fazilka, was a major obstacle.
67(Independent) Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier SS Choudhary was deployed for the
defence of Fazilka, comprised three Infantry Battalions (15 RAJPUT, 3 ASSAM, 4 JAT), 4
(Independent) Armoured Squadron of Deccan Horse equipped with Sherman tanks, one
Squadron 18 Cavalry equipped with T-54 tanks and two Troops 70 Armoured Regiment with
Jonga mounted SS11B1 missiles. It was supported by one Field Regiment and one Medium
Battery. Two BSF battalions were also under command.
All planning and preparations for the main defensive battle centred on Fazilka, which was to be
held at all cost. The line Sabuna Distributary-Qadir Bakhsh-Muazzam was to be held by a strong
Covering Force.Map

However, as the operational responsibility of the 67 (Independent) Infantry Brigade extended
over a large territory and there was shortage of troops, the Battalions were so deployed as to build
up either on the Sabuna Distributary or on Fazilka, depending on the direction of threat. Shortly
before the commencement of hostilities the Brigade was placed under command Foxtrot Sector
commanded by Major General Ram Singh. The Brigade was deployed across various areas as
follows: In the Shatirwala Area on the Sabuna Distributary, the deployment included 15
RAJPUT, less two Companies; three Companies from the 28 BSF Battalion; and two Companies
from the 22 BSF Battalion. In the Chananwala-Choriwala Chisti-Qadir Bakhsh-Khokhar Area
and along the Sabuna Distributary, the forces comprised 3 ASSAM, with one Company and two
Platoons from the 22 BSF Battalion; two Troops of 'B' Squadron 18 CAVALRY.
In the Muazzam-Fazilka region, North of the Railway Line Fazilka-Muktsar, the deployment
included two Companies of 15 RAJPUT and two Companies of 22 BSF Battalion. For the
Fazilka-South of Railway Line Fazilka-Muktsar area, the forces consisted of 4 JAT, 4
(Independent) Armoured Squadron, and B Squadron 18 CAVALRY less two Troops.
On 03 December, at about 1830 hours, Pakistan started shelling the area. Soon after, under the
cover of artillery fire and with some armour support, Pak troops charged through the forward
posts held by the BSF. 3 ASSAM deployed at the Sabuna Distributary was caught off guard and
its Company deployed at Pakka was attacked with one Infantry Battalion 6 Frontier Force (105
Infantry Brigade), and two troops of armour. Meanwhile, the Company Commander of 3
ASSAM was killed and this led to great confusion. Further, when the CO ordered the Covering
Troops to withdraw, the soldiers demolished all the bridges on the Sabuna Distributary, except
the Beriwala Bridge. Taking advantage of the chaos, the Pakistani troops crossed the BeriwalaBridge and established a foothold on the Sabuna Distributary at about 1930 hours on 03
December. The demolition of 22 bridges over the Sabuna Distributary, left little scope for a
successful counterattack by the Indians.

As the situation had to be restored at any cost, at 2330 hours, one Company of 4 JAT, supported
by B Squadron less two Troops of the 18 CAVALRY, launched a counterattack but were told to
move to Outfall due to the fog of war from where the enemy was cleared successfully.
The next day, Major Narain Singh, a Company Commander of 4 JAT was chosen to launch a
counter attack a day later and recapture the key Beriwala Bridge which could be used by the
Pakistani Army for a strong armor attack. When the counter-attack was launched, the enemy
brought down intense artillery and small arms fire inflicting heavy casualties on our troops.
Undeterred Major Narain Singh led his men and charged on to the objective. During this process,
he was hit by a burst from a machine gun but he continued to direct the operation. Eventually he
engaged the enemy in hand to hand fighting during which he was mortally wounded. Major
Narain Singh was a brave soldier and gritty officer, who led from the front and laid down his life
in the line of his duty. The Jats, having failed to recapture the bridge, re-established themselves
on the tail end of the Sabuna Distributary. 3 ASSAM held the distributary South of the Beriwala
Bridge.Indian soldiers atop a tank

The operations in Fazilka sector were characterized by fierce fighting, stretching over a period of
14 days. 4 JAT, 3/11 GORKHA RIFLES and 15 RAJPUTS suffered heavy casualties, mainly
caused by small arms and artillery shelling. In these operations Indian casualties mounted to 189
killed (including 11 officers and 10 JCOs), 425 wounded and 196 missing. Major Narain Singh
was given the gallantry award, ""Vir Chakra"" for his outstanding courage, leadership and supreme
sacrifice.

On 29 July 1987, a historic accord known as the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord was signed by then
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President J. R. Jayewardene in Colombo.
According to this agreement, India participated directly in counterinsurgency operations in Sri
Lanka against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) during the Sri Lankan Civil War.1
The Sri Lankan civil war has raged since 1983, making it one of the longest and most intractable
armed conflicts in South Asia.2 It has taken the lives of more than 60,000 Sri Lankans, and has
made refugees out of more than 300,000 people. Sri-Lanka occupies a strategic place in the
Indian Ocean region and a multi ethnic and multi religious land. Eighty two percent of the
population is Sinhala and follows Buddhism; and the remaining 18 percent are Tamil and
predominantly Hindu.

The Sri Lankan Government tried to put down the Tamil movement by force but this resulted in
the Tamil’s taking to guerrilla warfare. This soon resulted in a large number of refugees
emigrating to the southern Indian state Tamil Nadu, which created considerable problems for
India. After protracted negotiations, in which leaders of various Tamil groups were involved, anagreement was reached between Sri Lanka and India on 29 July 1987. As per the agreement, an
Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) was inducted into Sri Lanka on 03 August 1987.3 It was
India's first international peacekeeping mission post-independence. The objective was to
eliminate the LTTE from control on the Jaffna Peninsula and impose disarmament. With a total
with a military strength of 100,000 soldiers, the IPKF ran a classic counter-insurgency (CI)
campaign from December 1987 to March 1990. Due to this even when the LTTE tried to take
back Jaffna they were not able to. This operation is also known as OPERATION PAWAN.

On the night of 12 October 1987, the General in command of the IPKF claimed he had
intelligence that the Jaffna University complex was being used by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam as their headquarters and the top LTTE leadership would be meeting there. Accordingly,
he planned a heliborne operation to capture the LTTE leadership at the University after which
the plan was to capture the Jaffna town.
Major General Sheonan Singh was the Second-in-Command of 10 PARA Commando and was
deployed to Sri Lanka. During his entire service he never compromised in quality of work and

and bravely. In the initial stage of operations, he led a heliborne task force into the LTTE
Headquarters then located in the Jaffna University.
The assault was to begin at the Jaffna University grounds - a few kilometres from the IPKF
headquarters at the Palali airbase. Major General Singh and his men were tasked with clearing
space for the assault forces. On 12 October 1987, they heli-landed at Kokkavil to secure the
Battalion position for an assault on the militant's Headquarters in Kondavil area. After landing,
Major General Sheonan Singh occupied buildings directly opposite the militant's headquarters.
He and his commandos brought pressure on militants’ headquarters and inflicted casualties. He
held on to his position for a period of 28 hours. During this period of 28 hours, his force was
surrounded from all directions and effectively engaged by the militants from dominating
buildings. The task force was heavily outnumbered but it continued its efforts to complete the
task till ordered to pull back.

The first battalion of Gurkha Regiment (now GORKHA RIFLES) was raised in 1815 during
the Anglo-Nepalese war. Impressed by the qualities displayed by Gurkhas during the war, the
British started active recruitment of Gurkhas into the British Indian army. After the partition,
in 1947 six Gurkha regiments viz, 1 GR, 3 GR, 4 GR, 5 GR, 8 GR and 9 GR remained with the
Indian Army, while 2 GR, 6 GR, 7 GR and 10 GR were transferred to British Army as part of
the Tripartite Agreement signed between India, Nepal and Britain. The 4 GORKHA RIFLESwas raised in 1817. It was formerly known as the Fourth Prince of Wales’s Own Gurkha
Regiment. Before the reorganisation in 1857, it was known as the Extra Goorkha Regiment
and following the reorganisation it was named as the 19th Regiment of the Bengal Native
Infantry. In 1950, after India gained its republic status, it was renamed to be the 4 GORKHA
RIFLES REGIMENT of the Indian Army. The Regiment fought in Europe during World War
I and Middle East, North Africa and Italy during World War II. Since independence, the
regiment has proved its mettle three Indo-Pak Wars of 1947-48, 1965 and in 1971 and has been

fought a fine action at Bilafond La, at heights of nearly 20,000 feet (6,100 m) in 1987. The 1st
Battalion (JETHI) was awarded the COAS Unit","in 2002, for its performance in counter
terrorism operations in Kupwara district, Kashmir. The Battalion was commended for
neutralizing 94 Foreign Terrorists, in a number of operations in Tangdhar, Panzgam and Lolab.
The Regiment’s motto is ‘Kafar Hunu Bhanda Marnu Ramro’ (Better to die than live like
a coward).
Operation MEGHDOOT is an ongoing operation along North-Western Border region of India
in high altitude area of Siachen Glacier, ranging above 21000 feet. Launched on 13 April 1984,
this unique military operation was the first assault launched in the world's highest battlefield.
The military action resulted in Indian troops gaining control of the strategically located Siachen
Glacier. It is considered as a feat unparalleled in the history of high-altitude warfare where
soldiers of Indian Army and Air Force operate under most adverse weather conditions with
sub-zero temperatures of minus 50C.1
The Siachen Glacier is the second longest glacier in the world. The scroll of honour at Indian
Army’s Siachen Base Camp reads, “Quartered in snow, silent to remain. When the bugle
calls, they shall rise and march again.”2 Beneath the veneer of this bleak beauty lie menacing
hazards that snatch away human lives if one is not careful. Given the significance of this
Glacier, it provided a strategic importance to India, Pakistan and China as it served as a hub
for Shaksham Valley and Karakoram Pass.3

Siachen area has been a bone of contention between Pakistan and India for many years. The
root cause of the issue can be traced back to the Karachi Agreement of 1949. The
representatives of both the nations drew the ‘Ceasefire Line’ across maps of Jammu and
Kashmir from Manawar in the South, to Khor in the North and thence ‘North to the Glaciers’
through NJ 9842. Presumably when the discussion came up on the glaciated wilderness of snow
and ice the representatives stopped at grid Point NJ 9842 on the presumption that neither side
would be interested in contesting an area where not a blade of grass grows and even breathing
is a problem. The problem started when Pakistan decided to further their ambitions which
complicated the issue. They illegally ceded some 5180 square kilometers of Indian territory to
China in the area where the boundaries of India, Pakistan and China meet thereby altering the
geo-strategic importance of this area. Secondly, by permitting and assisting foreign
mountaineering and scientific expeditions in the area it raised the issue of ‘rights’ in an area
that did not belong to them. The cartographic ambiguities of 1962 and Pakistan’s growing
devious nature had concerned the Indian Army. In mid-seventies reports of foreign
mountaineering expeditions crossing the Saltoro Ridge and Siachen Glacier from Pakistan side
came to India’s notice. It was also learnt that Pakistan Army officers accompanied these
expeditions. As a result of these reports to establish our own claim to the area a mountaineering
expedition led by one of the Indian Army’s leading mountaineers, Colonel Narinder (Bull)Kumar, was sent to area in 1978. The expedition went to Tersam Kangri and in 1984 the Indian
Army took pre-emptive action and occupied Saltoro Range.
In April 1984 Operation Meghdoot: Indian Army under the leadership of Lieutenant General
Manohar Lal Chibber, and Lieutenant General PN Hoon and Major General Shiv Sharma,
learned of the plan by Pakistan Army to seize Sia La, and Bilafond La, on the glacier. Indian
Army launched an operation to pre-empt the seizure of the passes by the Pakistan Army.

The task of establishing Indian Army’s presence over Siachen Glacier was entrusted to 26
Sector commanded by Brigadier VN Channa. 4 KUMAON, supported by a Company of
Ladakh Scouts and two Companies of 19 KUMAON commanded by Lieutenant Colonel ( later
Brigadier) DK Khanna were in turn tasked to occupy the Siachen Glacier Complex . Before
undertaking the task, the Company Group carried out rigorous training for several weeks,
which included ice craft, snow craft, survival on snow and physical fitness and mental
robustness. The operation 'Meghdoot' was led by Major (later Colonel) RS Sandhu, VrC. The
next wave under Captain (later Lieutenant General) Sanjay Kulkarni, landed on the Glacier,
and hoisted the Indian Tricolour on Bilafond La (Siachen Glacier). The foot column led by
Captain (later Lieutenant Colonel) PV Yadav, SM, reached the Glacier subsequently, after anextremely strenuous four-day march over extremely inhospitable terrain. The column set up
Camps I, II and III for maintenance of newly established Posts on the Glacier. Companies of
Kumaon Battalion were given responsibility for the security of the line of communication of
these Posts.4 Op MEGHDOOT was executed in the morning of 13 April 1984 and pre-empted
Pakistan’s impending Operation Ababeel. Indian soldiers managed to control all major
mountain passes of Sia La, Bilafond La and by 1987 Gyong La and all the commanding heights
of the Saltoro Ridge west of the Siachen Glacier.5

In 1987, Pakistan ordered their own troops to establish a Post in Bilafond La in the Indian
territory which was named as Quaid Post after Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. In order
to take control of the Post, India launched an operation codenamed Operation RAJIV to capture
the peak. The operation was named after Second Lieutenant Rajiv Pandey who led a team of
soldiers tasked to capture a feature called Left Shoulder at 21000 feet lying between two Indian
Posts. During the final assault on 29 May 1987, he was killed.6 Quaid Post was located on a

Siachen Glacier region situated at the height of 20,000 Feet was attacked by the adversary and
had suffered heavy casualties in an attack on 18 September 1987. Lance Naik Hira Bahadur
Thapa of 3/4 GORKHA RIFLES was posted at Siachen Glacier area, where his Company
occupied defences at Bilafondla Complex. On the night of 23/24 September 1987, enemy
troops launched determined attacks on his Post but were repulsed. He was on duty on an
observation post. During his vigil in the face of sub-zero temperature, and the fierce glacial
winds, he detected some movement in front of the post and immediately informed his platoon
commander, who alerted his troops. The adversary's attack on the post was repulsed with heavy
casualties due to the timely warning. On the same night, the enemy launched two more
determined attacks. Lance Naik Hira Bahadur Thapa and his commander put up a gallant fight
and beat back the attack.
Again, on the night of 24/25 September 1987, the adversary launched another attack in
overwhelming numbers on a neighbouring post. Lance Naik Thapa and a few others were
ordered to reinforce the post. As the party was-progressing towards the neighbouring post
overran exposed terrain, they were pinned down by effective fire from the enemy's medium
machine gun detachment. When others were searching for cover, this gallant soldier, with utter
disregard for his own safety, charged on the enemy's medium machine gun detachment. En-

In 1987, Pakistan ordered their own troops to establish a Post in Bilafond La in the Indian
territory which was named as Quaid Post after Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. In
order to take control of the Post, India launched an operation codenamed Operation RAJIV to
capture the peak. The operation was named after Second Lieutenant Rajiv Pandey who led a
team of soldiers tasked to capture a feature called Left Shoulder at 21000 feet lying between
two Indian Posts. During the final assault on 29 May 1987, he was killed.6 Quaid Post was

Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (JAK LI) is an Infantry Regiment under the Indian Army.
The Regimental history of JAK LI is very unique. In 1947, when Pakistani troops intruded
into the Indian territory, militia groups were raised from the locals of Jammu, Nubra and Leh
under the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs. The militia fought with great distinction in the
1965 Indo-Pak War. However, it was the gallant actions of the militia troop in the Indo-Pak
War of 1971, that earned them three battle honours. After the war in 1972, the militia was
converted into a full-fledged Regiment and in 1976 the name was changed to Jammu and
Kashmir Light Infantry. The JAK LI has been deployed in the Indian Peacekeeping Force in
Sri Lanka in 1987 and also in the United Nations Mission in Somalia. In 1984, JAK LI wasdeployed to the Siachen Glacier during Op MEGHDOOT. 8 JAK LI earned great honour by
capturing a Pakistani post at 21000 feet at the Siachen Glacier in 1987. Subedar Bana Singh
of this Regiment has been awarded the Param Vir Chakra.
Operation MEGHDOOT is an ongoing operation along North-Western Border region of India
in high altitude area of Siachen Glacier, ranging above 21000 feet. Launched on 13 April 1984,
this unique military operation is the world's highest battlefield. The military action resulted in
Indian troops gaining control of the strategically located Siachen Glacier. It is considered as a
feat unparalleled in the history of high-altitude warfare where soldiers of Indian Army and Air
Force operate under most adverse weather conditions with sub-zero temperatures of minus
50℃.1
The Siachen Glacier is the second longest glacier in the world. The scroll of honour at Indian
Army’s Siachen Base Camp reads, “Quartered in snow, silent to remain. When the bugle
calls, they shall rise and march again.”2 Beneath the veneer of this bleak beauty lie menacing
hazards that snatch away human lives if one is not careful. Given the significance of this
Glacier, it provided a strategic importance to India, Pakistan and China as it served as a hub
for Shaksham Valley and Karakoram Pass.3

Siachen area has been a bone of contention between Pakistan and India for many years. The
root cause of the issue can be traced back to the Karachi Agreement of 1949. The
representatives of both the nations drew the ‘Ceasefire Line’ across maps of Jammu and
Kashmir from Manawar in the South, to Khor in the North and thence ‘North to the Glaciers’
through NJ 9842. Presumably when the discussion came up on the glaciated wilderness of snow
and ice the representatives stopped at grid Point NJ 9842 on the presumption that neither side
would be interested in contesting an area where not a blade of grass grows and even breathing
is a problem. The problem started when Pakistan decided to further their ambitions which
complicated the issue. They illegally ceded some 5180 square kilometers of Indian territory to
China in the area where the boundaries of India, Pakistan and China meet thereby altering the
geo-strategic importance of this area. Secondly, by permitting and assisting foreign
mountaineering and scientific expeditions in the area it raised the issue of ‘rights’ in an area
that did not belong to them. The cartographic ambiguities of 1962 and Pakistan’s growing
devious nature had concerned the Indian Army. In mid-seventies reports of foreign
mountaineering expeditions crossing the Saltoro Ridge and Siachen Glacier from Pakistan side
came to India’s notice. It was also learnt that Pakistan Army officers accompanied these
expeditions. As a result of these reports to establish our own claim to the area a mountaineering
expedition led by one of the Indian Army’s leading mountaineers, Colonel Narinder (Bull)
Kumar, was sent to area in 1978. The expedition went to Tersam Kangri and in 1984 the IndianArmy took pre-emptive action and occupied Saltoro Range.
In April 1984 Operation Meghdoot: Indian Army under the leadership of Lieutenant General
Manohar Lal Chibber, and Lieutenant General PN Hoon and Major General Shiv Sharma,
learned of the plan by Pakistan Army to seize Sia La, and Bilafond La, on the glacier. Indian
Army launched an operation to pre-empt the seizure of the passes by the Pakistan Army.

The Indian Army Service Corps (IASC) is a Corps and an arm of the Indian Army which
handles its logistic support function. It is the oldest and the largest administrative service in the
Indian Army. The origin of the corps goes back to 1760 when a Commissariat used to exist in
the administrative component of the armies three Presidencies of Bengal, Madras and Bombay.
In 1878 the separate Commissariats were amalgamated into a single entity and then in 1901 it
was renamed the Supply and Transport Corps. During the First World War the Corps became
a permanent component of the British Indian Army and was renamed the Indian Army Service
Corps in 1923. In 1935 the corps was granted the 'Royal' prefix and became known as Royal
Indian Army Service Corps (RIASC). After India gained independence in 1947, the corps
underwent further expansion and by 1948 Indian Catering Corps and Indian Army Corps of
Clerks were amalgamated into the corps. The Food Testing Laboratories were also placedunder the control of RIASC. On 8 December 1950, after India became a republic, the Corps

Operation MEGHDOOT is an ongoing operation along North-Western Border region of India
in high altitude area of Siachen Glacier, ranging above 21000 feet. Launched on 13 April 1984,
this unique military operation was the first assault launched in the world's highest battlefield.
The military action resulted in Indian troops gaining control of the strategically located Siachen
Glacier. It is considered as a feat unparalleled in the history of high-altitude warfare where
soldiers of Indian Army and Air Force operate under most adverse weather conditions with
sub-zero temperatures of minus 50C.1
The Siachen Glacier is the second longest glacier in the world. The scroll of honour at Indian
Army’s Siachen Base Camp reads, “Quartered in snow, silent to remain. When the bugle
calls, they shall rise and march again.”2 Beneath the veneer of this bleak beauty lie menacing
hazards that snatch away human lives if one is not careful. Given the significance of this
Glacier, it provided a strategic importance to India, Pakistan and China as it served as a hub
for Shaksham Valley and Karakoram Pass.3

Siachen area has been a bone of contention between Pakistan and India for many years. The
root cause of the issue can be traced back to the Karachi Agreement of 1949. The
representatives of both the nations drew the ‘Ceasefire Line’ across maps of Jammu and
Kashmir from Manawar in the South, to Khor in the North and thence ‘North to the Glaciers’
through NJ 9842. Presumably when the discussion came up on the glaciated wilderness of snow
and ice the representatives stopped at grid Point NJ 9842 on the presumption that neither side
would be interested in contesting an area where not a blade of grass grows and even breathing
is a problem. The problem started when Pakistan decided to further their ambitions which
complicated the issue. They illegally ceded some 5180 square kilometers of Indian territory to
China in the area where the boundaries of India, Pakistan and China meet thereby altering the
geo-strategic importance of this area. Secondly, by permitting and assisting foreign
mountaineering and scientific expeditions in the area it raised the issue of ‘rights’ in an area
that did not belong to them. The cartographic ambiguities of 1962 and Pakistan’s growing
devious nature had concerned the Indian Army. In mid-seventies reports of foreign
mountaineering expeditions crossing the Saltoro Ridge and Siachen Glacier from Pakistan sidecame to India’s notice. It was also learnt that Pakistan Army officers accompanied these
expeditions. As a result of these reports to establish our own claim to the area a mountaineering
expedition led by one of the Indian Army’s leading mountaineers, Colonel Narinder (Bull)
Kumar, was sent to area in 1978. The expedition went to Tersam Kangri and though in 1984
took pre-emptive action and occupied Saltoro Range.
In April 1984 Operation Meghdoot: Indian Army under the leadership of Lieutenant General
Manohar Lal Chibber, and Lieutenant General PN Hoon and Major General Shiv Sharma,
learned of the plan by Pakistan Army to seize Sia La, and Bilafond La, on the glacier. Indian
Army launched an operation to pre-empt the seizure of the passes by the Pakistan Army

The task of establishing Indian Army’s presence over Siachen Glacier was entrusted to 4
KUMAON, supported by a Company of Ladakh Scouts and two Companies of another Kumaon
Battalion. Before undertaking the task, the Company Group carried out rigorous training for
several weeks, which included ice craft, snow craft, survival on snow and physical fitness and
mental robustness. The operation 'Meghdoot' was led by Major (later Colonel) RS Sandhu,
VrC. The next wave under Captain (later Lieutenant General) Sanjay Kulkarni, landed on the
Glacier, and hoisted the Indian Tricolour on Bilafond La (Siachen Glacier). The foot column
led by Captain (later Lieutenant Colonel) PV Yadav, SM, reached the Glacier subsequently,
after an extremely strenuous four-day march over extremely inhospitable terrain. The column
set up Camps I, II and III for maintenance of newly established Posts on the Glacier. Companiesof Kumaon Battalion were given responsibility for the security of the line of communication
of these posts.4 Op MEGHDOOT was executed in the morning of 13 April 1984 and pre-
empted Pakistan’s impending Operation Ababeel. Indian soldiers managed to control all major
mountain passes of Sia La, Bilafond La and by 1987 Gyong La and all the commanding heights
of the Saltoro Ridge west of the Siachen Glacier.5

In 1987, Pakistan ordered their own troops to establish a Post in Bilafond La in the Indian
territory which was named as Quaid Post after Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. In order
to take control of the Post, India launched an operation codenamed Operation RAJIV to capture
the peak. The operation was named after Second Lieutenant Rajiv Pandey who led a team of
soldiers tasked to capture a feature called Left Shoulder at 21000 feet lying between two Indian
posts. During the final assault on 29 May 1987, he was killed.6 Quaid Post was located on a
massive ice mass located at an altitude of 21,153 feet above sea level. The steep ice-wall of
Quaid Post gives it a very dominating position and to defend it one has to just take potshots at

which they fixed four ropes and ladder system on the ice wall below the Post. This attack was
also successfully beaten back by our forces. The ropes and ladder system fixed by the
adversary, however, remained in position, making it possible for them to use it again in their
fresh attempts to take the Post. Second Lieutenant Ashok Choudhary took over as Post
Commander of this key post in Bilafondla Complex of Siachen Glacier on 15 May 1988. On
18 May 1988, despite inclement weather, it was decided to descend the forward ice wall and
cut the fixed ropes. Second Lieutenant Choudhary, with Rifleman Kunwar Singh, rappelled
down the steep ice wall 400 feet below, and swiftly located the ropes on the face of the ice wall
hanging by the belaying rope. He cut one rope with his knife. The weather was lifting rapidly,

Kargil War, Major Sah was tasked to lead the Charlie Company during the attack at Point 4700.
The Garhwal Rifles is a rifle regiment of the Indian Army. It was originally raised as the 39th
Garhwal Rifles of the Bengal Army, became part of the British Indian Army, and received its
present name on India's independence. On 05 May 1887, the first battalion was raised under the
command of Lieutenant Colonel EP Mainwaring at Almora. On 04 November 1887 this battalion
reached Kalundanda in Garhwal and in 1890 Kalundanda was renamed as Lansdowne. During
the First World War, the Garhwal Rifles were involved in the trench warfare and fought gallantly
where Naik Darwan Singh Negi and Rifleman Gabar Singh Negi were both awarded Victoria
Cross, and earned many awards for gallantry. The Garhwal Rifles received the rare honour of
being conferred with the ‘Royal’ title which was made official on 02 February 1921. The
regiment also fought during the Second World War and saw active service in almost all the
theatres of the war. Post-independence the regiment was transferred to the Indian Army. and took

The intruders from Pakistan had occupied well-coordinated defences on the heights. It was
imperative for the Indian Army to clear the enemy from these features to secure the highway.
One such feature was Point 4700, on the west of Point 5140 and east of Tololing Nala. This
feature was very crucial as the intruders had occupied this location after being evicted from
Tololing and Point 5140. The task to clear Point 4700 was given to the 18 Garhwal Rifles.

The Rajput Regiment is one of the oldest Infantry Regiments of the Indian Army, tracing its origins
to 1778 with the raising of the 24th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry. The 1st Battalion of the
Regiment was formed in 1798. After World War I, the Indian Army was restructured and most
Rajput Regiments became Battalions of the 7th Rajput Regiment. These included the 2nd Queen
Victoria's Own, 4th Prince Albert Victor's, 7th (Duke of Connaught's Own), and 11th Rajputs.
Before India gained independence from the British Empire, the Regiment consisted of Rajputs and
Punjabi Muslims. The Regimental insignia is a pair of crossed Rajputi Katars flanked by three
Ashoka leaves on either side. This is mounted by the Lion Capital of Ashoka and a scroll below
with the words ""The Rajput Regiment"". The Regimental motto of Rajput Regiment is ‘Sarvatra
Vijaya’ meaning ‘Victory everywhere’. In Operation VIJAY 1999, 27 RAJUPT displayed
exemplary valour in the battle fought at Point 5770. Field Marshal KM Cariappa, the first Indian
Army Chief and General VK Singh who was also the Army Chief both belong to the Rajput
Regiment and have been the Colonel of the Regiment.
The Kumaon Regiment traces its origins to the 18th century and has fought in every major
campaign of the British Indian Army and the Indian Army, including the two world wars. During
World War I, a Kumaon battalion was raised at Ranikhet on 23 October 1917 as 34/39th Kumaon
Rifles. In 1918, it was redesigned as 1st battalion, 50th Kumaon Rifles and a second battalion was
raised. These were merged with Hyderabad contingent into the 19th Hyderabad Regiment in 1923.
On 27 October 1945, the 19th Hyderabad was renamed as 19 Kumaon Regiment. Post-
Independence, it is known as the Kumaon Regiment. Staying true to the regimental motto of
Parakramo Vijayate (Valour Triumphs) the regiment has proved its mettle in Indo-Pak war of
1947-48, Sino-India War of 1962, Indo-Pak war 1971, Kargil War of 1999 and had been a part of
India’s Peace-keeping force in Sri Lanka. During the war on the icy heights of Kargil, Kumaon

Point 5770 (19,000 feet) on the ridgeline abutting the Southern Glacier was another unoccupied
feature. In June 1999, Pakistani activity was observed on the Western face of Point 5770. It was
soon confirmed that the Pakistanis were in the process of establishing a Post on this unheld
mountain top. They called it Balal Post. Orders were given to 27 RAJPUT to launch an assault and

(Pg no 104-105)Ladakh Division when the orders were received. The Battalion moved with gusto and began its
preparations for launching what was obviously a very difficult attack. While the Spur leading up
to Point 5770 from the Pakistani side was gradual, the two Spurs leading up from the Indian side
were both steep, almost vertical cliff faces. In order to achieve surprise, without which the task
would have been well-nigh impossible, it was decided to assault up an almost vertical incline using
special mountaineering techniques.
A hand-picked dedicated team of trained mountaineers was nominated. The responsibility to lead
the Assault Party was assigned by the CO, Colonel (later Lieutenant General) KH Singh to Major
N S Cheema, SM. He led from the front and was assisted by Instructors from the High Altitude
Warfare School (HAWS), Sonamarg, and some personnel of Ladakh Scouts; the rest of the team
comprised men from 27 RAJPUT. Artillery firing was not resorted to and strict signals
communications discipline was maintained in order to achieve surprise. The Team took four days
to fix ropes on the mountain and reached within 20 metres of the last ridgeline. It was a crevasse
ridden route with near-vertical rock faces, cornices, overhangs and areas susceptible to avalanches.
They then decided to rest for a day and launch the assault on 27 June 1999. By 1330 hours, the
Team had climbed 1,800 feet using the previously fixed ropes. The last few metres were covered
with utmost stealth and, quite amazingly, the Assault Team achieved total surprise. At 1430 hours,
the Rajputs charged on a startled sentry on the nearest bunker on the mountain. Ten enemy
personnel from 3 NLI were found ensconced in a fibreglass hut nearby. A fire-fight ensued and
the Indian troops soon closed in with the Hut. Hand grenades were lobbed inside and the Pakistanis
were eliminated.
Captain Sinha was tasked for opening a route to the Top. On reaching the Top, Captain Sinha
assaulted the enemy position firing from the hip and lobbing grenades. Some enemy personnel,
totally surprised by the bold and daredevil nature of the assault team, ran helter skelter towards the
Capt Shayamal Sinha, VrC southwestern direction and rolled down the steep ledge into a deep
nala. However, four enemy personnel from the leading two sangars engaged the assault team with
automatic weapons. Disregarding his own safety, Captain Sinha charged towards the sangars and,
in the ensuing hand-to-hand combat, silenced the enemy resistance with professional acumen,
using a UMG that he captured from the enemy. A large quantity of arms and ammunition was also
captured. For displaying conspicuous courage and a fearless fighting spirit in the face of the enemy,

completed his secondary education form Sainik School in Satara. Ever since his school days he
was determined to join Indian Army. After completing his schooling, he joined the National
Defense Academy (NDA) and got commissioned into the Grenadiers regiment on 07 June 1997.
The Grenadiers regiment was formerly a part of the Bombay Army and later in pre-independence
India, the regiment was known as 4th Bombay Grenadiers. They distinguished themselves in two
world wars and have won battle honours Gurez, Assal Uttar, Jarpal and Chakra. During the Kargil
War, 18 GRENADIERS captured the formidable Tiger Hill complex, and participated in battles
of Hump & Tololing.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and
Kashmir by any means. The Kargil war of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The war
commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the Pakistan army
surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is thought to be the

one of the most dominating and awe-inspiring features in the Dras sector. The Pakistani soldiers
who had occupied the Tiger Hill complex in strength were bringing effective artillery on large
tracts of the National Highway 1A. Eviction of the enemy from this feature was urgent and
necessary. The Tiger Hill was the key to enemy position in the Dras Sector. The Tiger Hill complex
was isolated from the North, South and East by 8 SIKH on 21 May 1999. However, the isolation
from the West could not be done as the complete ridge line was occupied by the enemy. The Indian

height of 16,500 feet, navigating torrents while under intense enemy artillery shelling and fire.
Undaunted and unfazed, he advanced towards the enemy position through darkness and inclement
weather for over twelve hours. As soon as he came in close proximity of the enemy position,
he created a firebase near the enemy position and began a cliff assault with his soldiers using
mountaineering equipment. He made it to the top and caught the enemies off guard. He directed his
men to encircle the enemy and set up automatic weapons to prevent the enemy from fleeing. Using
combat knives and bayonets, he began clearing the enemies. The combat went on until day break.

The Rajputana Rifles is the senior most Rifle Regiment of the Indian Army. Its first battalion was
raised in January 1775. The Rajputana Rifles has a long and glorious history. The regiment took
part in some of the bloodiest battles in many theatres of the world. During World War II, thebattalions of this regiment fought in every theatre in which the Indian Army was involved. Three
of them, the 1st, 4th and Medium Machine Gun Battalions fought in Eritrea in North Africa and
Italy as part of the famous 4th Indian Division, whose fighting record was one of the finest in World
War II. Post-independence the regiment took part in many battles and operations including the UN
Peacekeeping Mission in Congo. The Rajputana Rifles fought gallantly in the 1965 and 1971 India-
Pakistan wars. During the Kargil War, the Rajputana Rifles displayed exemplary valour and
determination especially in the Tololing. During Op THUNDERBOLT, Captain Haneef Uddin,
young valiant officer of 11 Rajputana Rifles made the supreme sacrifice during an assault to
capture a position near Sub-sector West (SSW).

The Southern Glacier and Sub-Sector West were a beehive of activities during the Kargil war. In
early-May 1999, after a patrol clash in the area, minor intrusions (200 to 500 meters) were
discovered along the LC south of the Shyok River. Brigadier P C Katoch commander of 102
Infantry Brigade decided to pre-empt further expansion by occupying defences along all important
mountain features up to Chorbat La Pass on the Ladakh Range and the watershed. The decision to
occupy defences along the Turtuk Lungpa prevented further ingress and provided a firm base for
launching attacks to evict the intruders. 11 RAJ RIF, was in the process of deinducting after
completing its tenure at the Central Glacier. On 11 May 1999, the battalion was quickly moved
through the Turtuk Lungpa to occupy defences on the LC at Point 5500 and adjacent areas. 11

Captain Roy was the Second-in-Command (2IC) of the Delta Company during the operation at
Point 4700.
The GARHWAL RIFLES is a rifle regiment of the Indian Army. It was originally raised as the
39th Garhwal Rifles of the Bengal Army, became part of the British Indian Army, and received
its present name on India's independence. On 05 May 1887, the first battalion was raised under
the command of Lieutenant Colonel EP Mainwaring at Almora. On 04 November 1887 this
battalion reached Kalundanda in Garhwal and in 1890 Kalundanda was renamed as Lansdowne.
During the First World War, the GARHWAL RIFLES were involved in the trench warfare and
fought gallantly where Naik Darwan Singh Negi and Rifleman Gabar Singh Negi were both
awarded Victoria Cross, and earned many awards for gallantry. The GARHWAL RIFLES
received the rare honour of being conferred with the ‘Royal’ title which was made official on 02

Point 5140 and Point 4700 in the Dras sector and received the Unit","from the then Chief
of the Army Staff, General VP Malik.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu

war commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the Pakistan
army surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is thought to

(Pg no 104-105)The intruders from Pakistan had occupied well-coordinated defences on the heights. It was
imperative for the Indian Army to clear the enemy from these features to secure the highway.
One such feature was Point 4700, on the west of Point 5140 and east of Tololing Nala. This
feature was very crucial as the intruders had occupied this location after being evicted from
Tololing and Point 5140. The task to clear Point 4700 was given to the 18 GARHWAL RIFLES.
Colonel SK Chakravarty, the Commanding Officer of 18 GARHWAL RIFLES completed his
reconnaissance and gave orders to attack. Alpha Company secured the firm base and the F
echelon (the fighting troops) moved forward on the night of 27-28 June 1999. The C and D
company under Major Rajesh Sah and Major SK Joshi respectively and reached 300 to 400
meters of their objective without major opposition from the enemy.
Captain Sumeet Roy was the second-in-command (2IC) of the Delta Company tasked to capture
Point 4700 in the Dras sector on 28 June 1999. The officer was tasked to capture the observation
post of the enemy. At 2330 Hrs he set out with a section adopting a covered approach and
reached the spot right below the observation post. He executed an outflanking move along the
treacherous route to Point 4700 and occupied it to neutralise any other observation posts around
it. On 29 June 1999, Captain Roy, with complete disregard of his personal safety, climbed up the
steep cliff and surprised the enemy as he attacked the observation post. Moreover, in a fierce
physical combat, he killed both the enemy sentries. The surprise attack created panic among the
enemy and the enemy was forced to fled the post. In the process, the enemy left behind huge
quantity of arms and ammunition. On 03 July 1999, Captain Roy was injured by artillery shelling

Cannanore, Kerela. He studied in Kendriya Vidyalaya, MEG Centre Bangalore. Captain
Maridhyodhan Veetil Sooraj commissioned into 18 GARHWAL RIFLES of the Indian Army on
12 December 1998. During the Kargil War, Captain Sooraj was the Second-in-Command of the
Charlie Company and displayed exemplary leadership, indomitable spirit, and courage in the face
of the enemy during the capture of Point 4700 in Dras sector.
The GARHWAL RIFLES is a light infantry or Rifle Regiment of the Indian Army. It came into
existence on 05 May 1887 at the instance of Field Marshal Sir FS Roberts, the then Command-in-
Chief of India. Lieutenant Colonel EP Mainwaring raised the First battalion at Almora on 05 May
1887 and moved it to Kaludanda (later renamed as Lansdowne after the then Viceroy of India) on
04 November 1887. The Regimental Centre was established at Lansdowne on 01 October 1921.
During the First World War, the Garhwal Rifles were involved in the trench warfare and fought
gallantly and earned many bravery awards including two Victoria Crosses. The GARHWAL
RIFLES received the rare honour of being conferred with the ‘Royal’ title which was made official
on 02 February 1921. The Regiment also fought during the Second World War and after the
independence was transferred to the union of India. Post-independence the GARHWAL RIFLES
have fought in the 1962 India-China War, 1965 and 1971 India-Pakistan Wars. During the Kargil

The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and
Kashmir by any means. The Kargil war of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The war
commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the Pakistan army
surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is thought to be the
brain-child of General Pervez Musharraf, then Chief of the Pakistan Army. On 03 May 1999,
intrusions were detected. On 26 May 1, the first air to ground strike was launched by the Indian
Airforce (IAF), followed by OPERATION VIJAY, by the Indian Army to evict the intruders from
the Indian territory2. After two months of violent confrontation, the war came to an end on 26 July

The rugged hill tops in Dras Sector had specific features which provided dominating viewpoints
of the National Highway 1 Alpha. The intruders from Pakistan had formed a well-coordinated
defensive layout along those features. It was imperative for the Indian Army to clear the enemy
from these features to secure the highway. One such feature was Point 4700, a ridgeline on the
west of Pt 5140 and east of Tololing Nala. This feature was very crucial as the intruders has
occupied this location after being evicted from Tololing and Point 5140. The task to clear Point
4700 was given to the 18 Garhwal Rifles. Colonel SK Chakravarty, the Commanding Officer of
the unit completed his reconnaissance and gave orders to attack. The A Company secured the firm
base and the F Echelon (the fighting troops) moved forward on the night of 27-28 June 1999. The
C and D Companies under Major Rajesh Sah and Major SK Joshi respectively and reached 300 to
400 meters of their objective without major opposition from the enemy.
During OPERATION VIJAY, Captain Sooraj, Second-in-Command of Charlie Company, was
tasked to capture Point 4700 in the Dras area from the north on 29 June, 1999. It was a challenging
approach since, in addition to the objective, two other targets were interfering. Captain
Maridhyodhan Veetil Sooraj determined to reach the Top and kept moving his troops tactically. In
doing so he got hit by an artillery splinter in his hand and leg. Unmindful of his injury he kept
moving up. When he was only thirty metres from the summit, he was shot in the waist and hip,
and the attack almost became critical. Captain Maridhyodhan Veetil Sooraj demonstratedcamaraderie and great leadership, inspiring his troops to leave him and capture the target. Without

get evacuated till the objective was captured. Motivated by their leader's resolve, the troops
captured the objective.

Forces was evident from a young age. He joined the Indian Army in the 12 JAMMU AND
KASHMIR LIGHT INFANTRY (12 JAK LI) on 10 January 1972. JAK LI is a renowned infantry
unit celebrated for its brave soldiers and a series of heroic military accomplishments. Subedar
Singh was married to Pyari Devi and had three children, daughter Anju Bala and two sons, Pawan
Kumar and Kamal Kumar.
In 1999, Subedar Bahadur Singh had completed close to 28 years of his service life in the Army,
accumulating experiences across a spectrum of demanding and challenging operations. In 1997,
he was assigned to the challenging Siachen region, where he displayed resilience and dedication
during his two-year tenure in one of the most demanding and harsh work environments. However,
as the Kargil operations unfolded in the early days of May 1999, Subedar Bahadur Singh's unit,
the 12 JAK LI, was repositioned to the Batalik sector, where they actively engaged in the
forthcoming operations.
Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (JAK LI) is an Infantry Regiment of the Indian Army. The
Regimental history of JAK LI is very unique. In 1947, when Pakistani troops intruded into the
Indian territory, Militia groups were raised from the locals of Jammu, Nubra and Leh under the
Ministry of Home Affairs. The Militia fought with great distinction in the 1965 India Pakistan
War. However, it was the gallant action of the militia troops in the India Pakistan War of 1971 that
earned them three battle honours. After the War, in 1972, the Militia was converted into a full-
fledged Regiment and in 1976 the name was changed to Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry. The
JAK LI was deployed in the Indian Peacekeeping Force in Sri Lanka in 1987 and also in the United
Nations Mission in Somalia. During the Kargil War, the 12 Jammu Kashmir Light Infantry was
tasked to capture Point 4812 in the Batalik Sector, for which the unit received “unit","” from

The challenges in the Batalik Sub-Sector were manifold as the enemy had intruded almost 8-10
km from the LC and occupied an unheld area West of the Chorbat La Pass. The 12 JAK LI was
inducted into the Batalik Sub-Sector on 09 May 1999. The 12 JAKLI was given the task of driving
a wedge between the enemy’s defences at Point 5203 (Eastern extremity) and Point 4812-Point
5287-Point 5000 (the Khalubar Ridgeline). The Battalion under Colonel VS Bhalothia
accomplished this difficult task by infiltrating through the Junk Lungpa Nala under the nose of the
enemy. As part of 70 Infantry Brigade’s plan to roll up the flanks of the enemy’s intrusion first
and then proceed inwards and tighten the noose around the inner tier of defences from both East
and West, a battalion attack was planned to recapture the Point 5203 complex. Point 5203 was a
formidable feature on the eastern extremity of the area of intrusion in the Batalik sub-sector. The
assault by 12 JAK LI was launched on 07 June 1999 and the A Company under Major Sanjiv Dutt
and Captain Amol Kalia along with a Company of 5 PARA set out from the Junk Lungpa Nala at
2130 hours. One Platoon reached the top of the Ridgeline by first light and secured a small
lodgment within striking distance of the enemy.
The enemy succeeded in reinforcing his position but the battalion tenaciously hung on to the
lodgment that it had gained at such high cost. One squad of 10 PARA (SF — Special Forces) and
a section of 5 PARA reached Major D K Dutt's company as reinforcements. Thirteen gallant
warriors of 12 JAK LI made the supreme sacrifice in the two counter-attacks that night
Major Dutt's mixed group stayed in contact with the enemy on the Point 5203 ridgeline and
continued to cause attrition. The troops were out in the open and were subjected to daily doses of
heavy small arms and machine gun fire. There were many acts of individual and collective heroism
during this period. On 11 June 1999, Subedar Bahadur Singh volunteered to neutralise one of the
enemy positions that was taking a heavy toll. Accompanied by two other soldiers, he advanced
into terrain totally devoid of any natural cover, stealthily outflanked the enemy from the north and
gained proximity to his defences. The enemy ultimately detected the move and heavy automatic
fire was directed at Subedar Bahadur Singh's party. Although the enemy was in a dominating
position, Subedar Bahadur Singh fearlessly fired back, killing two enemy soldiers on the spot. A
fierce fire-fight ensued and Subedar Bahadur Singh sustained a bullet injury. Refusing to be
evacuated, he continued to fire back at the enemy till he succumbed another bullet injury. His men
destroyed the enemy sangar before pulling back.

The RAJPUTANA RIFLES is the senior most Rifle Regiment of the Indian Army. Its first
battalion was raised in January 1775. The RAJPUTANA RIFLES has a long and glorious history.
The regiment took part in some of the bloodiest battles in many theatres of the world. During
World War II, the battalions of this regiment fought in every theatre in which the Indian Army was
involved. Three of them, the 1st, 4th and Medium Machine Gun Battalions fought in Eritrea in
North Africa and Italy as part of the famous 4th Indian Division, whose fighting record was one of
the finest in World War II. Post-independence the Regiment took part in many battles and
operations including the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Congo. The RAJPUTANA RIFLES fought
gallantly in the 1965 and 1971 India-Pakistan wars. During the Kargil War, the RAJPUTANA
RIFLES displayed exemplary valour and determination especially in the Tololing Operation. The
2 RAJ RIF was conferred India’s first ‘Instant Unit","’ by General VP Malik, the then Chief
of the Army Staff. During the Kargil War, the men of this Regiment displayed exceptional bravery
and fortitude in the capture of Tololing Heights.CHM Piru Ram of this Regiment was awarded the
PVC during the 1947-48 Indo -Pak conflict.
The Kargil War of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict
can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan are the
attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. The war
commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the Pakistan Army
surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is thought to be the
brain-child of General Pervez Musharraf, then Chief of the Pakistan Army. On 03 May 1999,intrusions were detected. On 26 May, the first air to ground strike was launched by the Indian
Airforce (IAF), followed by Operation Vijay, by the Indian Army to evict the intruders from the
Indian territory. After two months of violent confrontation, the war came to an end on 26 July
1999.
The Tololing Heights was the deepest penetration beyond the LC by the Pakistani intruders. As
the Kargil War progressed, the capture of Tololing became essential to flush out the Pakistani
intruders. 56 Mountain Brigade was given the task to capture Tololing. Tololing and another
feature named Point 4590 were among the vital peaks for India. Both the peaks were crucial as
they overlooked the Dras Sector and a large section of National Highway, giving enemy a visual
access to every movement on the National Highway. The intruders at the Tololing top stayed put
and didn’t open fire until they were discovered on 12 May 1999. This time was utilized by the
intruders to build coordinated defences that would enable the enemy to bring effective fire on
attacking troops.

made several attempts and were able to encircle them in the span of two weeks. During the attempts
to recapture the Tololing Top, 18 GRENADIERS also lost a valiant officer Major Rajesh Singh
Adhikari on 30 May 1999. The responsibility to capture the Top was then assigned to 2
RAJPUTANA RIFLES, a Battallion which operated in the valley and had undergone extensive
training at the Corps Battle School in Khrew. 2 RAJ RIF reached Dras Sector on 01 June 1999.
To recapture the Tololing Top and the surrounding features, a multi-directional attack plan was
approved by Major General (later Lieutenant General) Mohinder Puri, General Officer
Commanding 8 Mountain Division. To ensure that the plan was a success, it was absolutely
necessary to have adequate artillery fire units for each assaulting Battalion, since the multi-
directional attack should begin at the same time otherwise enemy would guess the direction of
attack and take appropriate action. However, later it was decided to stagger the attack and ensure
adequate artillery support for all assaulting troops. 2 RAJ RIF was tasked to capture the Tololing
Top by 0600 hours on 13 June 1999. Subedar Bhawar Lal was part of this attack led by Major
Vivek Gupta.

The success achieved on the eventful night of 12-13 June 1999 would not have been possible
without the great heroism of the junior leaders and soldiers of 2 RAJ RIF. On night 12-13 June,Subedar Bhawar Lal was leading his Platoon to capture Tololing Top. As they closed in with the
objective, the enemy brought down heavy fire on them. The leading Section of his Platoon suffered
three casualties and the attack was stalled temporarily. At this juncture, Subedar Bhawar Lal took
the lead and kept exhorting his Section to move ahead. 50 meters short of the enemy positions, he
got a burst of Light Machine Gun fire but unmindful of his injuries, he moved ahead with his men.
Seeing their Platoon Commander hobbling selflessly forward, the soldiers were motivated and in
one final assault snatched the Tololing Top from the enemy. Shortly after, Subedar Bhawar Lal
succumbed to his injuries at the base of the enemy position. The enthused Section could destroy
the enemy position only due to the excellent leadership of Subedar Bhawar Lal.

The Jammu & Kashmir Rifles has a unique regimental history. It was raised in 1821, by an intrepid
Indian ruler Gulab Singh. He was one of the ablest Generals of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and later
became the ruler of the Jammu and Kashmir state. As a state force, Jammu & Kashmir Rifles
fought as Imperial Service troops in both World War I and II and contributed immensely during
1947-48 war. The Jammu and Kashmir Rifles was later absorbed into the Indian Army as a distinct
and separate regiment. In 1963, the designation was changed to Jammu & Kashmir Rifles. After
conversion, the Ladakh Scouts became a part of the regiment and has recently become a full-
fledged regiment. During the Kargil conflict in 1999, the Jammu & Kashmir Rifles created an
unprecedented record of bravery and sacrifice.

therefore, extensive day and night patrolling was done, including registration of targets for artillery
fire support. By the night of 04 July 1999, 13 Jammu & Kashmir Rifles was ready to advance to

11 RAJPUTANA RIFLES, an Infantry Regiment known for its brave soldiers and numerous
battle honours on 08 November 1977. After completing his training, he served in various
operational areas and developed into a dedicated soldier.
After serving for few years he got married to Ms. Santosh and the couple had three sons Vikram

The Rajputana Rifles was raised in 1921 as 6th Rajputana Rifles following the merger of six
British Indian army regiments. In 1945 the numeral sign “6” was dropped and it became the
Rajputana Rifles. It is India’s first rifle regiment. A rifle regiment is so called because all
infantry troops in the regiment are armed with rifles. This was at a time when most soldiers
fought with muskets or swords. The soldiers of a Rifle Regiment were known as riflemen. The
area of Rajputana comprises more than 20 princely states, notably Bikaner, Jaipur, Jodhpur,
Udaipur, and Ajmer, during the British rule. All these states merged with the Indian Union
following independence in 1947. The Regiment has an equal share of troops who are Rajputs and
Jats. The battle cry of the Rajputana Rifles is “Raja Ramchandra ki Jai” (Hail Lord Rama). A
battalion of Rajputana Rifles was part of 99 Infantry Brigade Group in ONUC from 1961-63.
The regiment has won several battle honors and theater honors. This Regiment has contributed
immensely in both pre and post-independence wars fought by India. In the year 1999, during the

In 1999, it was very early days of Kargil War when there was very less information available
about the enemy troops. A company of 11 RAJPUTANA RIFLES was deployed in Operation
Thunderbolt on 06 June 1999 at an altitude of 18,000 feet in the Turtuk region. Their mission
was to capture a position in the region which would facilitate the Army to monitor the
movements of the enemy troops better. The capture of this position would give the troops a
strategic advantage in those early stages of the war. During OPERATION VIJAY, Naib Subedar
Mangej Singh’s battalion was deployed in J&K along the LoC and he was part of a patrol tasked
with establishing a foothold and establishing a station at Point 5590 in the Turtuk sector on 06
June 1999. They made significant strides on the nights of 04 and 05 June and captured nearby
positions. They captured the adjacent position and set out their advance on 06 June to capture the
objective for which they had been tasked. They were undeterred by an altitude of 18,500 feet and
extreme temperatures. They were however spotted by the enemy and fired upon. A firefight
followed, against an enemy equipped with heavy artillery.
Though the fire support role, Naib Subedar Mangej Singh volunteered for the patrol and was
given command of the Medium Machine Gun detachment. As the patrol advanced ahead
employing fire and move tactics, Naib Subedar Mangej Singh tactically used the automatic
weapon. The enemy launched heavy automatic fire on our men when the patrol was 50 metres
away from the objective. The medium machine gun was taken over by Naib Subedar Mangej
Singh, who directly engaged the attackers.4 The medium machine gun was positioned without
cover in open terrain. He was wounded in the chest by gunshots during the firefight.
Naib Subedar Mangej Singh, undeterred by his wounded and oblivious to his own safety,
maintained firing on the enemy until the patrol was able to evade hostile fire. He received more
bullets in his belly as a result during the firefight, and he gave his life fighting the enemy. Naib

Ludhiana Sikhs by Captain G Tebbs and Lieutenant Colonel P Gordon respectively. They
participated effectively in the 1857 First War of Independence. This war proved to be beneficial
for the Sikhs as it revealed their valour and fighting tenacity. Under the British Indian Army, the
Sikh Regiment fought gallantly in a number of war and battles including the Battle of Saragarhi in
which they left an indelible mark in the regiment’s history. By 1914 the Sikh Regiment was
deployed as part of British Indian Army for operations in World War I. The Regiment served in
all theatres of operations and earned 28 battle honours. The modern SIKH Regiment traces its roots

The Tiger Hill Complex is one of the most dominating and awe-inspiring features in the Dras
Sector. The Pakistani soldiers who had occupied the Tiger Hill Complex in strength were bringing
effective artillery on large tracts of the National Highway 1A. Eviction of the enemy from this
feature was urgent and necessary. The Tiger Hill was the key enemy position in the Dras Sector.
The Tiger Hill Complex was isolated from the North, South and East by 8 SIKH on 21 May 1999.
However, the isolation from the West could not be done as the complete ridge line was occupied
by the enemy. The Indian Army moreover was not permitted to cross the Line of Control to get
behind the enemy to cut his line of communications. To completely isolate the enemy on Tiger
Hill, Colonel Kaushal Thakur the Commanding Officer of 18 GRENADIERS, applied the lessons
learnt earlier at the Tololing and Hump and decided a multidirectional attack, with the majority of
force level assaulting from unexpected direction. The attack on Tiger Hill commenced on 03 July
1999 at 2030 hours. By 0400 Hours of 05 July 1999, 18 GRENADIERS and 8 SIKH were able to
capture several important features of Tiger Hill and succeeded in completely isolating the enemy
sitting at the Tiger Hill Top.8 SIKH was inducted into the Dras Sub-Sector on 14 May 1999 and had cleared Point 4195, Point
4460 and the area around Pariyon ka Talab by 18 May 1999. Since then, 8 SIKH was in contact
with the enemy at Tiger Hill and had contained and prevented further expansion of the enemy's
defences, besides causing substantive attrition. They had isolated Tiger Hill from three directions
and had provided a firm base to 18 GRENADIERS for the attack on Tiger Hill. Simultaneously, 8
SIKH had simulated attacks from the Southern and Northern directions. One Company of the
Battalion was nominated as reserve. 8 SIKH was now given the task to facilitate the early capture
of Tiger Hill by capturing its Western spur, including Helmet and India Gate, so as to prevent the
reinforcement of Tiger Hill Top. The move was also intended to cut off the enemy's supply route
to Tiger Hill. The Western Spur of Tiger Hill extended 1.5 km and was well held. The approach
to it lay along a steep rock face with a gradient of 75 to 80 degrees. Colonel SP Singh, Commanding
Officer of 8 SIKH formed his Ghatak Platoon. Major Ravindra Singh was nominated to lead an ad
hoc column comprising Lieutenant R K Sehrawat, four Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs) and
52 jawans. In a daring assault on the night of 04-05 July 1999, Major Ravinder Singh’s Column
climbed steadily under withering fire, helped only by the poor visibility caused by dense fog and
pouring rain. The SIKHs established a fire base 200 metres from the objective, neutralised a
machine gun sited on a vantage point and quickly charged uphill to occupy the feature named India
Gate. The dreaded war cry of the SIKH, “Bole So Nihal, Sat Sri Akal”, sent shivers down the
spines of the intruders and cheered the Grinders on the other side.
Naib Subedar Karnail Singh and a Section of 8 SIKH were deployed on the reverse slope of Area
Helmet when they came under heavy enemy fire from Tiger Hill, Rocky Knob and a feature called
Trig Height at around 0600 hours on 06 July 1999. Heavy fire from three directions was soon
followed by a counter-attack with 15 enemy personnel. The enemy managed to close in and an
intense hand-to-hand fight ensued. Though outnumbered, Naib Subedar Karnail Singh and his men
fought back with immense courage and gave back measure for measure. Leading from the front
and rallying his men around him, Naib Subedar Karnail Singh and the jawans with him were
seriously wounded in the fire-fight but managed to hold on. The enemy launched a second counter-

Meerut District, Uttar Pradesh. His father’s name was Girwar Singh. CHM Yashvir Singh joined
2 RAJPUTANA RIFLES of the Indian Army on 29 June 1979 at the age of 19. During the Kargil
War, he was part of the assault on Tololing Top in Dras Sector where he displayed outstanding
gallantry in the face of enemy and sacrificed himself for the nation. He was awarded Vir Chakra
posthumously. CHM Yashvir Singh was married to Manesh Devi and had two children, Uday
and Pankaj.1
The RAJPUTANA RIFLES is the senior most Rifle Regiment of the Indian Army. Its first
battalion was raised in January 1775. The RAJPUTANA RIFLES has a long and glorious
history. The regiment took part in some of the bloodiest battles in many theatres of the world.
During World War II, the battalions of this regiment fought in every theatre in which the Indian
Army was involved. Three of them, the 1st, 4th and Medium Machine Gun Battalions fought in
Eritrea in North Africa and Italy as part of the famous 4th Indian Division, whose fighting record
was one of the finest in World War II. Post-independence the Regiment took part in many battles
and operations including the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Congo. The RAJPUTANA RIFLES
fought gallantly in the 1965 and 1971 India-Pakistan wars. During the Kargil War, the
RAJPUTANA RIFLES displayed exemplary valour and determination especially in the Tololing
Operation. The 2 RAJ RIF was conferred India’s first ‘Instant Unit","’ by General VP
Malik, the then Chief of the Army Staff. During the Kargil War, the men of this regiment
displayed exceptional bravery and fortitude in the capture of Tololing Heights.
The Kargil war of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The genesis of Indo-Pak
conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan
are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means.
The war commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the
Pakistan army surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is
thought to be the brain-child of General Pervez Musharraf, then Chief of the Pakistan Army. On
03 May 1999, intrusions were detected. On 26 May, the first air to ground strike was launched by
the Indian Airforce (IAF), followed by Operation Vijay, by the Indian Army to evict the
intruders from the Indian territory. After two months of violent confrontation, the war came to an
end on 26 July 1999.
The Tololing Heights was the deepest penetration beyond the LC by the Pakistani intruders. As
the Kargil War progressed, the capture of Tololing became essential to flush out the Pakistani
intruders. 56 Mountain Brigade was given the task to capture Tololing. Tololing and another
1 CHM Yashvir Singh (Accessed on 07 Jul 1999)
https://www.jatland.com/home/Yash_Vir_Singh_Tomarfeature named Point 4590 were among the vital peaks for India. Both the peaks were crucial as
they overlooked the Dras Sector and a large section of National Highway, giving enemy a visual
access to every movement on the National Highway. The intruders at the Tololing top stayed put
and didn’t open fire until they were discovered on 12 May 1999. This time was utilized by the
intruders to build coordinated defences that would enable the enemy to bring effective fire on
attacking troops.
On 22 May 1999, 18 GRENADIERS launched their first attack on the Tololing top. The
battalion made several attempts and were able to encircle them in the span of two weeks. During
the attempts to recapture the Tololing Top, 18 GRENADIERS also lost a valiant officer Major
Rajesh Singh Adhikari on 30 May 1999. The responsibility to capture the top was then assigned
to 2 Rajputana Rifles, a regiment which operated in the valley and had undergone extensive
training at the Corps Battle School in Khrew. The unit of 2 RAJ RIF reached Dras Sector on 01
June 1999.

approved by Major General (later Lieutenant General) Mohinder Puri, General Officer
Commanding 8 Mountain Division. To ensure plan was a success, it was absolutely necessary to
have adequate artillery fire unites for each assaulting Battalion, since the multi-directional attack
should begin at the same time otherwise enemy would guess the direction of attack and take
appropriate action. However, later it was decided to stagger the attack and ensure adequate
artillery support for all assaulting troops. The 2 RAJ RIF was tasked to capture the Tololing Top
by 0600 hour on 13 June 1999. When the Battalion launched the attack, Major Vivek Gupta was
in command of the leading Charlie Company and Company Havildar Major Yashvir Singh was
charged with organising the evacuation of casualties during the Company assault. The Company
had taken Tololing top and lost the Company Commander and Platoon Commander in the
ensuing firefight. The Troops on Tololing Top were in the danger of being isolated by the
enemy.
Seeing the grave situation of own troops on top and the lurking danger to the accomplishment of
task, Company Havildar Major Yashvir Singh mustered all spare men around him and rushed to
the Top. As soon as he reached there, he teamed up with the survivors of Number One Section
and assumed the leadership. When he saw that an uncleared enemy sangar was posing a threat to
Tololing Top, he gathered all the hand grenades and proceeded to the sangar, despite heavy
enemy fire. As he got closer, he started throwing grenades inside through the loopholes, but he
was fired at point blank range by the enemy. He was able to silence the bunker after throwing
eighteen grenades. However, in this gallant action, he sustained innumerable bullet injuries and
succumbed as a result of the profuse bleeding.
Throughout the action, Company Havildar Major Yashvir Singh, displayed great valour in the
face of the enemy and made the ultimate sacrifice for the country. He was awarded Vir Chakra
posthumously for his gallantry.CITATION

East by 8 SIKH on 21 May 1999. However, the isolation from the West could not be done as the
complete ridge line was occupied by the enemy. The Indian Army moreover was not permitted to
cross the Line of Control to get behind the enemy to cut his line of communication.3 To completely
isolate the enemies on Tiger Hill, Colonel Kaushal Thakur the commanding officer of 18

1999.
West of the Kaobal Gali, beyond Zoji La Pass, was in the area of responsibility of India’s 28
Infantry Division. Here too, it was important to ensure that the attempts of the enemy to intrude
into the territory on the Indian side of the LoC were nipped in the bud. Hence, vigorous patrolling
was carried out and operations were launched to dominate the LoC and the areas across it by
observation and fire. In one such operation by 8 JAT, Havildar Sis Ram Gill was assigned the task
of leading a team for the domination of a 17,000 feet high feature close to the LoC over extremely
difficult and rugged terrain.

The Rajput Regiment is one of the oldest Infantry Regiments of the Indian Army, tracing its origins
to 1778 with the raising of the 24th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry. The 1st Battalion of the
Regiment was formed in 1798. After World War I, the Indian Army was restructured and most
Rajput Regiments became Battalions of the 7th Rajput Regiment. These included the 2nd Queen
Victoria's Own, 4th Prince Albert Victor's, 7th (Duke of Connaught's Own), and 11th Rajputs.
Before India gained independence from the British Empire, the Regiment consisted of Rajputs and
Punjabi Muslims. The Regimental insignia is a pair of crossed Rajputi Katars flanked by three
Ashoka leaves on either side. This is mounted by the Lion Capital of Ashoka and a scroll below
with the words ""The Rajput Regiment"". The Regimental motto of Rajput Regiment is ‘Sarvatra
Vijaya’ meaning ‘Victory everywhere’. In Operation VIJAY 1999, 27 RAJUPT displayed
exemplary valour in the battle fought at Point 5770. Field Marshal KM Cariappa, the first IndianArmy Chief and General VK Singh who was also the Army Chief both belong to the Rajput
Regiment and have been the Colonel of the Regiment.
Point 5770 (19,000 feet) on the ridgeline abutting the Southern Glacier was another unoccupied
feature. In June 1999, Pakistani activity was observed on the Western face of Point 5770. It was
soon confirmed that the Pakistanis were in the process of establishing a Post on this unheld
mountain top. They called it Balal Post. Orders were given to 27 RAJPUT to launch an assault and
evict enemy troops from this post. 27 RAJPUT was in the process of being inducted into the
Ladakh Division when the orders were received. The Battalion moved with gusto and began its
preparations for launching what was obviously a very difficult attack. While the Spur leading up
to Point 5770 from the Pakistani side was gradual, the two Spurs leading up from the Indian side
were both steep, almost vertical cliff faces. In order to achieve surprise, without which the task
would have been well-nigh impossible, it was decided to assault up an almost vertical incline using
special mountaineering techniques.
A hand-picked dedicated team of trained mountaineers was nominated. The responsibility to lead
the Assault Party was assigned by the CO, Colonel (later Lieutenant General) KH Singh to Major
N S Cheema, SM. He led from the front and was assisted by Instructors from the High Altitude
Warfare School (HAWS), Sonamarg, and some personnel of Ladakh Scouts; the rest of the team
comprised men from 27 RAJPUT. Artillery firing was not resorted to and strict signals
communications discipline was maintained in order to achieve surprise. The Team took four days
to fix ropes on the mountain and reached within 20 metres of the last ridgeline. It was a crevasse
ridden route with near-vertical rock faces, cornices, overhangs and areas susceptible to avalanches.
They then decided to rest for a day and launch the assault on 27 June 1999. By 1330 hours, the
Team had climbed 1,800 feet using the previously fixed ropes. The last few metres were covered
with utmost stealth and, quite amazingly, the Assault Team achieved total surprise. At 1430 hours,
the Rajputs charged on a startled sentry on the nearest bunker on the mountain. Ten enemy
personnel from 3 NLI were found ensconced in a fibreglass hut nearby. A fire-fight ensued and
the Indian troops soon closed in with the Hut. Hand grenades were lobbed inside and the Pakistanis
were eliminated.
Havildar Joginder Singh was a member of the Assault Party on 27 June 1999. On reaching the Top
after an arduous climb, Havildar Joginder Singh fearlessly assaulted the enemy bunkers and
engaged the enemy in a close quarter battle. After assisting in silencing the bunkers, he led the
assault on the enemy's fibreglass hut. Firing from the hip and lobbing hand grenades, Havildar
Joginder Singh stormed the hut and killed the enemy soldiers inside. He then chased and fired
upon the enemy personnel rushing down the steep ledge into a deep nala towards the West.Havildar Joginder Singh displayed conspicuous courage and an exemplary fighting spirit in the
face of the enemy under trying conditions and was awarded the Vir Chakra. The bodies of Captain
Taimur Malik of 3 NLI and other Pakistani soldiers were brought down and handed over at Kargil.
Given the extremely high altitude and the adverse climatic conditions, the assault launched by 27
Rajput was incredibly successful. Such success could have been achieved only through
indomitable determination, supreme mental resolve, utmost dedication and outstanding gallantry.
The Post continues to be held and has been named ""Navdeep Top"" in honour of the brave Company
Commander, Major N S Cheema, SM, who led the assault.
The gallant actions of all the battalions that participated in Operation Vijay in Sub-Sector Haneef
ensured that the watershed was safe in Indian hands and that an approach to Thoise airfield could
be permanently denied to the enemy. The men fought on some of the highest mountain features in
the world in the most trying climatic conditions with fortitude and utmost devotion to duty in the
finest traditions of the Indian Army. That they triumphed against daunting odds speaks volumes
for their physical fitness and their indomitable willpower. The successful assault on Point 5770
was reminiscent of the capture of Bana Top on the Saltoro Ridge in 1987 and even surpassed it in
audacity. Indeed, it was an unparalleled heroic effort.","4180458, Havildar Joginder Singh, KUMAON, 27 RAJPUT

Havildar Joginder Singh of High-Altitude Warfare School (HAWS) was attached with 27
RAJPUT. 27 RAJPUT was tasked to capture the strategic post of Point 5770 opposite own
Southern Glacier. The post was constantly harassing own post Saddle through observation and
small arms fire. The Plan to capture Point 5770 was to achieve moral ascendance in GULAB
Complex.
With total disregard to his personal safety in the face of devastating enemy artillery and small arms
fire, Havildar Joginder Singh assaulted the bunkers firing from the hip and lobbing grenades.
Seeing the bold and daredevil attacks of Havildar Joginder Singh, the enemy ran towards the South
westerly direction but were shot down. Havildar Joginder Singh also observed eight to ten enemy
personnel rolling down the sheer steep ledge into a deep nullah towards West. However, four
enemy personnel from the two forward bunkers engaged the assault team with automatic weapons.
With utter disregard to his personal safety, Havildar Joginder Singh charged towards the bunkers
and in the ensuing hand-to-hand fight, silenced the enemy resistance using Universal Machine Gun

parents’ names were Tashi Mutup and Sonam Angmo. He was enrolled in Ladakh Scouts of the
Indian Army on 21 August 1984. During the Kargil War, he was part of the operation at Chorbat
La in Batalik Sub-Sector where he displayed unflinching devotion to duty and disregarded his own
safety in pre emptying the enemy occupation. He made the supreme sacrifice for the nation during
the action and was awarded Vir Cakra posthumously.
The Ladakh Scouts known as the “Snow Warriors” were initially raised as a Para Military Force
formed of the Ladakhi locals known as Nubra Guards to save Ladakh from intruders in 1948. It
comprises of Ladakhi locals who are physically fit and attuned with the rugged terrain and hostile
climate. On 1 June 1963, following the Indo China War of 1962, the Ladakh Scouts was formed
from the nucleus of the 7th and 14th battalion of the J&K Militia. It had two Wings- the Karakoram
Wing, defending the Eastern front facing China and the Indus Wing facing Pakistan. The Regiment
currently consists of five battalions. The Regiment has also fought in the 1965 and 1971 India
Pakistan War. They were also part of Operation Meghdoot in 1984. Ladakh Scouts was converted
into a Regiment in the 2000. The Ladakh Scouts played a significant role during the Kargil War
of 1999 and was awarded the Unit","and later received the Chief of Army Banner.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and
Kashmir by any means. The Kargil war of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The war
commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the Pakistan army
surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is thought to be the
brain-child of General Pervez Musharraf, then Chief of the Pakistan Army. On 03 May 1999,
intrusions were detected. On 26 May 1, the first air to ground strike was launched by the Indian
Airforce (IAF), followed by Operation Vijay, by the Indian Army to evict the intruders from the
Indian territory2. After two months of violent confrontation, the war came to an end on 26 July
1999.
The enemy soldiers had begun their preparation long before and categorically managed to capture
dominant hill tops. One such tactical point was the Chorbat La pass located in the Batalik sub
sector at 18000 feet along the Line of Control. Historically, Chorbat La was used as a gateway for
intruders. The intrusion into the Batalik sub-sector by the enemy indicated their innate plans of
expanding the area for easier passage of goods and ammunition to sustain the war. Therefore, it
became imperative to secure Chorbat La before India could set out its operation in the other sectors.

shocked to find out enemy tents just along the ridgeline. As they prepared to inform Major
Wangchuk over the radio about the enemy’s action on the LoC, they came under enemy fire. Major
Wangchuk left with a team as reinforcement for the patrol stuck under the enemy fire. When Major
Wangchuk reached the location, they received a burst of bullets from the enemy and one Non-

glaciated area at 5,500 metres on 30 May 1999, to prevent enemy occupancy and infiltration. His
Section came under effective fire from an enemy ambush while scaling an ice wall with an 80-

the capture of the important features of Point 4875- Pimple Complex and Whaleback in Mashkoh
valley.
The Jat Regiment is one of the oldest regiments of the Indian Army. It is an infantry regiment
that claims its origins to the Calcutta Native Militia raised in 1795, which later became an
infantry battalion of the Bengal Army. Jat people were historically considered to be martial class
and were enlisted in the British Army as per the policy on class regiments. In 1922, during the
grouping of the class regiment the 9 JAT was formed by bringing under a single regiment, four
active and one training battalion. In the post-independent era, the Jat regiment has lived up to
their reputation and holds the distinction of fighting in all the wars that India fought since its
independence including with the IPKF in Sri Lanka. Their battle cry: Jat Balwan, Jai Bhagwan
was adopted in 1955. 17 JAT received “Unit","” from General VP Malik, the then Chief of
the Army Staff for their conspicuous courage during the Kargil War.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention

In the beginning of 1990s, Mashkoh Valley was used by the Pakistan Army as an alternative
route for infiltration of terrorists into the Kashmir Valley. So, every year during summer months,
Indian Army launched counter infiltration operations to neutralise terrorists. However, in the
summer of 1999, the enemy had crossed the LC and occupied the high mountain tops. Of the
varied features in this sector the most important was Point 4875 which was held by the enemy.

themselves in two World Wars and have won battle honours Gurez, Assal Uttar, Jarpal and Chakra.

The Kargil War of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict

1999.
The Tololing Heights was the deepest penetration beyond the LoC by the Pakistani intruders. As
the Kargil War progressed, the capture of Tololing became essential to flush out the Pakistani
intruders. 56 Mountain Brigade was given the task to capture Tololing. Tololing and another
feature named Point 4590 were among the vital peaks for India. Both the peaks were crucial as
they overlooked the Dras Sector and a large section of National Highway, giving enemy a visual
access to every movement on the National Highway. The intruders at the Tololing top stayed put
and didn’t open fire until they were discovered on 12 May 1999. This time was utilized by the
intruders to build coordinated defences that would enable the enemy to bring effective fire on
attacking troops.
On 22 May 1999, 18 GRENADIERS launched their first attack on the Tololing top. The battalion
made several attempts and were able to encircle them in the span of two weeks. During the attempts
to recapture the Tololing Top, 18 GRENADIERS also lost a valiant officer Major Rajesh Singh
Adhikari on 30 May 1999.Panorama view of Point 5140 and Point 4590, Tololing

In order to facilitate the smooth passage of traffic along the route to Leh and other destinations,
the strategic acquisition of Point 4590 was taken in priority. 18 GRENADIERS was entrusted with
the mission to secure Point 4590 before dawn on 03 June, 1999. Remarkably, the GRENADIERS
successfully reached the top and secured the elevated position well before midnight. Significantly,
the capture of Point 4590 also marked the first significant triumph in the Kargil war.
During the attack, Lance Havildar Ram Kumar, the Commanding Officer's radio operator was also
in the assault group. During night attack on Point 4590 on 03 June, 1999, when the assaulting
troops came under enemy's automatic fire, Lance Havildar Ram Kumar, with utter disregard to
personal safety, crawled close to the enemy sangar from which a Universal Machine Gun (UMG)
was firing on the assaulting troops with a view to lobbing a grenade inside the sangar. When he
was close to the objective, he received gunshot wounds on the shoulder and waist. Unmindful of
his injuries, Havildar Ram Kumar continued to inch close to the sangar and succeeded in lobbing
a hand grenade, killing one of the occupants and injuring the other two. In the ensuing hand-to-

On 03 June 1999 during 'Operation Vijay', a battalion assault was launched by 18 Grenadiers on
Tololing in the Drass sector, to evict the Pakistan backed infiltrators located in a well-stocked and
fortified post at over 15,000 feet. Lance Havildar Ram Kumar was also in the assault group. When
the assault group was close to the objective, the enemy opened fire. With utter disregard to his
personal safety, Lance Havildar Ram Kumar crawled close to the enemy sangar from which
Universal machine gun fire was being directed. When he was close to the objective, he received a
gunshot wound on the shoulder and waist.

of Pune, Maharashtra. He completed his secondary education from the Bishop Cotton Boys’
school. Ever since his childhood he wanted to become an officer of Indian Army just like his
grandfather and father. On 3 September 1977, he was commissioned into Indian Army’s 7/11
Gorkha Rifles (GR). During the Kargil war, Colonel Lalit Rai was commanding 1/11 GR.
The first battalion of Gurkha Regiment (now Gorkha Rifles) was raised in 1815 during the Anglo-
Nepalese war. Impressed by the qualities displayed by Gurkhas during the war, the British started
active recruitment of Gurkhas into the British Indian army. After the partition, in 1947
six Gurkha regiments viz , 1 GR, 3 GR, 4 GR, 5 GR, 8 GR and 9 GR remained with the Indian
Army , while 2 GR, 6 GR, 7 GR and 10 GR were transferred to British Army as part of
the Tripartite Agreement signed between India, Nepal and Britain. The 11 GR is the only Gorkha
Regiment raised in Independent India. It was raised on 1 January 1948. Since independence, the
regiment has participated in a number of wars and operations including the 1947 and 1971 wars
against Pakistan. The battalion’s motto is ‘Yatraham Vijay Statra’ (We are metaphors of victory).
During the Kargil war, 1/11 GR was tasked to clear the Kalubhar Ridge.
The Kargil war of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict
can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan are the
attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. The war
commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the Pakistan army
surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is thought to be the
brain-child of General Pervez Musharraf, then chief of the Pakistan Army. On 3 May 1999,
intrusions were detected. On 26 May 1, the first air to ground strike was launched by the Indian
Airforce (IAF), followed by Operation Vijay, by the Indian Army to evict the intruders from the
Indian territory2. During Op VIJAY, Col Lalit Rai was tasked to lead the battalion of 1/11 GR and
capture the formidable Khalubar Top.

Col Lalit Rai displayed conspicuous bravery and contributed significantly to the capture of
Khalubar.3 The Khalubar is located at an altitude of 17,500 feet above sea level in a terrain which
is really tough and compounded with most inhospitable weather. The enemy had prepared well-
coordinated defences on the dominating heights of Kalubar. Due to the terrain advantage the
enemy had; the advancing Indian Forces were under constant effective fire from a very initial
stage. However, to reach the Line of Control (LC), it was extremely necessary to dislodge the
enemy from Khalubar heights. Col Lalit Rai was tasked to accomplish this seemingly impossible
task of capturing the Khalubar heights.
During the advance to capture formidable heights of Khalubar in the Batalik sub-sector, Colonel
Lalit Rai of 1/11 GR noticed that his troops were hemmed down by effective and intense enemy
fire. He was quick to realise the dangers of being daylighted in this vulnerable position and
instructed the Number 5 platoon to clear the interfering enemy positions while he led a small group
of troops to the top. Recognizing the threat, the enemy launched a counter attack from three sides
on our forces, with 30-40 troops on each side. Colonel Lalit Rai was hurt in the knee during this
counter-attack. Colonel Lalit Rai, despite his injury, exhorted and inspired his troops to fight
bravely by setting a very high personal example. He refused to be evacuated until the target was
achieved.

in a single charge. This capture proved to be a turning point in the Batalik sub-sector struggle.
During this operation, 25 enemy soldiers were killed, and a huge number of arms and ammunition,
including a Stinger missile, air defence guns, and crucial documents, were captured. Colonel Lalit
Rai exhibited outstanding gallantry in the face of intense enemy fire and contributed significantly
to the Batalik sub-sector’s triumph.

heights of Khalubar in the Batalik sub-sector. During the advance, own troops were pinned down
by effective and heavy volume of enemy fire. Realising the danger of getting day lighted in this
vulnerable position, Colonel Lalit Rai ordered the Number five platoon to clear the interfering
enemy positions while he himself led a handful of troops, available in front, to reach the top. The
enemy, realising the danger, counter-attacked our troops from three sides with 30-40 personnel.
During this counter attack, Colonel Lalit Rai was injured in the knee. In spite of the injury, Colonel
Lalit Rai exhorted and encouraged his troops to fight courageously by setting a very high standard
of personal example. He refused to be evacuated till such time the objective was captured.
This act boosted the morale of his troops, who regrouped and captured the objective in one charge.
This capture turned out to be the turning point in the battle of the Batalik sub-sector. This operation
accounted for killing of 25 enemy soldiers and capture of large amount of arms and ammunition
including a Stinger missile, air defence guns and important documents.

section of National Highway, giving enemy a visual access to every movement on the National
Highway. 18 GRENADIERS is known as the ‘Pole Star Battalion’ for its steadfastness in the
battlefield. Staying true to their name, within the time frame of five days the battalion acclimatized

The battle of Tololing was a pivotal battle of the Kargil War which turned the tide in favour of
India. Tololing is only 4 km from Dras, with excellent domination of the National Highway IA
(NH1A) by observation and fire, the life line to Leh. It is an ideal location to interdict the NH1A,
and the capture of Tololing was vital for the safety of the highway. Tololing is connected with
Point (Pt) 5140 via hill feature called Hump and formed a complex. Pt 5140 is a majestic feature,
imposing over the entire Toloing complex, from where the intruders were able to bring down
precise fire to interdict the highway. The ridge is located between two nalas, the Bimbat nala in
the east and the Tololing nala in the west, both flowing from north to south.
As the Kargil War progressed, the capture of Tololing became essential to flush out the Pakistani
intruders. On 19 May 1999, 56 Mountain Brigade was given the task to capture Tololing and on
23 May 1999, 18 GRENADIERS were deployed to capture Tololing. 1 Naga was tasked to attack
Pt 5140 from the East on 22 May 1999 so that it did not interfere with the capture of Tololing.
Attack on T ololing and Pt 5140 could not progress as planned due to heavy enemy fire and difficult
terrain, therefore the attack plan was revised. 18 GRENADIERS was now tasked to provide a firm
base and 2 RAJPUTANA RIFLES was to attack Tololing and secure the feature by 13 June 1999.
After more than three weeks of bitter fighting, Tololing Top was captured. This was the turning
point of Kargil conflict. 18 GRENADIERS had set the stage and 2 RAJPUTANA RIFLES finished
the task against overwhelming odds and at a great price. At this stage, 18 GRENADIERS was
ordered to maintain the momentum of attack and exploit the success to capture Hump. The
Grenadiers drove the enemy out of Hump and the adjacent Bumps. In mid-June 1999, 13 Jammu
and Kashmir Rifles (13 JAK Rifles) and 18 GRENADIERS were tasked to recapture Point 5140
(about 1500 metres North of Tololing on the same ridgeline) by 56 Mountain Brigade.The first objective, Rocky Knob at the base of Point 5140 and about 800 metres away provided
the best avenue for mounting an attack on Point 5140. It was allotted to 13 JAK Rifles. The attack
commenced on 15 June. Intense artillery shelling preceded the assault. As the battle raged on, the
commanding officer had to be evacuated due to medical reasons. Major Yogesh Kumar Joshi, the
second-in-command, was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and given the reins of the
battalion in the middle of the battle. While the capture of Rocky-Knob was in progress, Captain

of mind. His leadership from the front boosted the morale of his troops. Taking encouragement
from him, the attacking companies overcame adversity, inhospitable terrain and intense enemy fire
to finally capture strategic peak of Point 5140. The enemy had put in place seven sangars on Point
5140: two at the highest point and five towards the east. By the morning of 20 June, all these

IC-44616,Colonel (Then Major),Deepak Rampal,17 JAT,"Major Deepak Rampal was born on 24 November 1965 in Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh. He is an
alumnus of the National Defence Academy, Khadakwasla. He was commissioned into the Indian
Army on 13 June 1987 in the Jat Regiment. During the Kargil War, he was the Company
Commander of the Delta Company tasked to capture Whale Back, a strategic feature near Point
4875 in Mashkoh Valley.
The Jat Regiment is one of the oldest regiments of the Indian Army. It is an infantry regiment that
claims its origins to the Calcutta Native Militia raised in 1795, which later became an infantry
battalion of the Bengal Army. Jat people were historically considered to be martial class and were
enlisted in the British Army as per the policy on class regiments. In 1922, during the grouping of
the class regiment the 9 JAT was formed by bringing under a single regiment, four active and one
training battalion. In the post-independent era, the Jat regiment has lived up to their reputation and
holds the distinction of fighting in all the wars that India fought since its independence including
with the IPKF in Sri Lanka. Their battle cry: Jat Balwan, Jai Bhagwan was adopted in 1955. 17
JAT received “Unit","” from General VP Malik, the then Chief of the Army Staff for their
conspicuous courage during the Kargil War.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and
Kashmir by any means. The Kargil war of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The war
commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the Pakistan army
surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is thought to be the
brain-child of General Pervez Musharraf, then chief of the Pakistan Army. On 03 May 1999,
intrusions were detected. On 26 May 1, the first air to ground strike was launched by the Indian
Airforce (IAF), followed by Operation Vijay, by the Indian Army to evict the intruders from the
Indian territory2. After two months of violent confrontation, the war came to an end on 26 July
1999.
In the beginning of 1990s, Mashkoh Valley was used by the Pakistan Army as an alternative route
for infiltration of terrorists into the Kashmir Valley. So, every year during summer months Indian
Army launched counter infiltration operations to neutralise terrorists. However, in the summer of
1999, the enemy had crossed the LC and occupied the high mountain tops. Of the varied features
in this sector the most important was Point 4875 which was held by the enemy. The 17 JAT was
inducted into the valley on 26 May 1999 and was tasked to capture features Pimple 1, Pimple 2

attack in two phases. In the first phase, he planned to attack Pimple 1 and Whale Back from
Southwest and South respectively. He decided to capture Pimple 2 and North Spur in the second
phase. After successfully capturing features Pimple 1 and Whale Back in Phase 1 of the assault
on 05 July 1999, the CO decided to take a tactical pause for a day before launching Phase 2 of the
attack. The interlude was used to replenish ammunition before the assault on Pimple 2 was
launched. Capturing Whale Back in Phase 1 was significant as it would provide a base to begin
the second phase of the attack at the Pimple Complex. Whale Back was a dominating feature at
Point 4875 as it provided a good viewpoint for observing the Mashkoh valley completely.

The JAMMU AND KASHMIR RIFLES (JAK RIF) has a unique regimental history. It was raised
in 1821, by an intrepid Indian ruler Gulab Singh. He was one of the ablest Generals of Maharaja
Ranjit Singh and later became the ruler of the Jammu and Kashmir state. As a state force, Jammu

https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/himachaltribune/a-warrior-with-nerves-of-steel-702050and Kashmir Rifles fought as Imperial Service troops in both World War I and II and contributed
immensely during 1947-48 war. The Jammu and Kashmir Rifles was later absorbed into the Indian
Army as a distinct and separate regiment. In 1963, the designation was changed to Jammu and
Kashmir Rifles. After conversion, the Ladakh Scouts came under the aegis of the regiment and has
only recently acquired the title of a full-fledged regiment. During the Kargil conflict in 1999, the
JAMMU AND KASHMIR RIFLES created an unprecedented record of bravery and sacrifice.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and
Kashmir by any means. The Kargil war of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The war
commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the Pakistan army
surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is thought to be the
brain-child of General Pervez Musharraf, then Chief of the Pakistan Army. On 03 May 1999,
intrusions were detected. On 26 May 2, the first air to ground strike was launched by the Indian
Airforce (IAF), followed by Operation Vijay, by the Indian Army to evict the intruders from the
Indian territory3. After two months of violent confrontation, the war came to an end on 26 July
1999.
The capture of Tololing changed the dynamics of the war. The next important feature was to
capture Point 5140 and Point 4875 as these features provided dominant viewpoints to the National
Highway 1 Alpha. The task to conduct this operation was entrusted to the 13 JAK RIF. Lieutenant
Colonel Joshi decided to employ the B and D Company under Captain SS Jamwal and Captain
Vikram Batra respectively. It was after the success at Point 5140 that Captain Batra delivered his
iconic success signal “Yeh Dil Mange More”. Captain Vikram Batra was commanding D
Company tasked to capture Point 5140 on 20 June 1999. He reached closer to the objective despite
the treacherous terrain. He along with his Company moved from the East while maintaining
absolute silence achieving complete surprise. Captain Batra reorganised his column and displayed
exemplary leadership as he fought the enemy from the forefront. The officer’s action motivated
his men to physically attack the enemy positions. In an act of formidable courage, Captain Batra
pounced onto the enemy and killed four intruders in the physical combat.

In response to the Pakistani invasion of Kashmir in 1947, local militias were raised for specific
sectors, such as Jammu, Leh, Nubra, etc. The militias were a paramilitary force under the Indian
Ministry of Home Affairs and operated on the Line of Control. Following the Sino-Indian War of
1962, in 1963 the 7th and 14th Battalions of the J&K Militia were spun off to form the Ladakh
Scouts. The militias conducted themselves with great distinction during the Indo-Pakistan War of
1965 and earned three battle honours during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971. The troops of the
force felt strongly that they wanted the dignity and privileges of a regular Army unit, especially
keeping in mind their performance and sacrifice in the recent wars. Keeping this in mind, the
then head of the J&K Militia, Brigadier Lekhraj Singh Puar of the Garhwal Rifles, who was on
deputation to the Ministry of Home Affairs from the Indian Army, prepared and presented plans
to the Ministry of Home Affairs for conversion of the militia into regular units on his own
initiative. These efforts bore fruit, and in 1972, the J&K Militia was converted to a full-fledged
Army Regiment as the Jammu and Kashmir Militia under the Ministry of Defence. Brigadier
Puar went on to become the first Colonel of the Regiment. In 1976, the Regiment was renamed
as the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry. The Regiment has the distinction of having captured

The SIKH Regiment is one of the highest decorated regiments of the Indian Army. It came into
existence on 01 August 1846, with the raising of Regiment of Ferozepore Sikhs and Regiment of
Ludhiana Sikhs by Captain G Tebbs and Lieutenant Colonel P Gordon respectively. They
participated effectively in the 1857 First War of Independence. This war proved to be beneficial
for the Sikhs as it revealed their valour and fighting tenacity. Under the British Indian Army, the
Sikh Regiment fought gallantly in a number of war and battles including the Battle of Saragarhi in

effective artillery on large tracts of the National Highway 1A. Eviction of the enemy from this
feature was urgent and necessary. The Tiger hill was the key to enemy position in the Dras Sector.
The tiger hill complex was isolated from the North, South and East by 8 SIKH on 21 May 1999.
However, the isolation from the West could not be done as the complete ridge line was occupied
by the enemy. The Indian Army moreover was not permitted to cross the Line of Control to get
behind the enemy to cut his line of communication. To completely isolate the enemies on Tiger
Hill, Colonel Kaushal Thakur the commanding officer of 18 GRENADIERS, applied the lessons

Centre, Ranikhet Uttarakhand. It comprised of Naga rebels and ex- militants who joined Indian
Armed forces. While the training of these new recruits was still in progress there was turbulence
on the borders with then, East Pakistan. 1 NAGA was immediately deployed in the area. TheBattalion which was not yet fully trained and ready for combat found itself on the battle-front in
the Indo-Pak War of 1971. Yet, the Battalion displayed exceptional valour and combat skills in
the Indo-Pak War of 1971. On 11 February 1985, the second NAGA battalion (2 NAGA) was
raised at Haldwani. During the Kargil War, 1 NAGA was in Northern Command and the unit was
part of 56 Mountain Brigade of 8 Mountain Division. It contributed immensely in the capture of

successfully secured the Eastern and Northern flanks of Point 5140 and divided the enemy's
attention. The objective’s given to 1 NAGA in this coordinated attack by 56 Mountain Brigade
were to capture Black Tooth and Area Rocky. These objectives were to the South West of Point
5140. 1 NAGA had been the first additional Battalion to be inducted for Operation Vijay on 11
May 1999 and had participated in the early attacks on Point 5100 and Point 5140 during May 1999.
Popularly known as the Headhunters, the Nagas approached their objectives from the direction of
the Tolling Nala and established a firm base by first light on 18 June 1999. Colonel D A Patil, the
CO, decided to launch a simultaneous assault with two Companies. At 2030 hours on 18 June
1999, 'A' Company commenced its move to Area Rocky and 'B' Company to Black Tooth. The
nature of the terrain along the approach route and steady enemy artillery and small arms fire
retarded progress. Steep nalas and sheer cliffs enroute permitted climbing only on all fours. But
the Nagas were not daunted. At about 2300 hours. just about 100 metres short of the objective, 'A'
Company was held up by the sheer volume of enemy machine gun fire. The Company Commander
asked for artillery fire to destroy the sangars interfering with the attack. Major Abhay Tiwari of
197 Field Regiment was with the Headhunters and carefully coordinated the bombardment of the

After a pitched close quarter battle that lasted over one hour, the enemy withdrew. 'A' Company
again pressed forward and, amidst cries of ""Jai Durga Naga,"" and captured Rocky by 0100 hours
on 19 June 1999. 'B' Company's progress towards Black Tooth was even slower. Well sited enemy
sangars brought down effective fire on the assaulting troops. Repeated attempts throughout the
night to establish a foothold on Black Tooth failed. In fact, close reconnaissance during daylight
revealed that the enemy at Black Tooth had well-coordinated defences with medium and heavy
machine guns sited to cover all the approaches. 'B' Company's standoff lasted two more nights
during which the troops of 'A' Company remained deployed without cover on Area Rocky.
However, to the credit of the valiant men of 'B' Company, they kept on trying relentlessly to
dislodge the enemy from Black Tooth.
Sepoy K Ashuli participated in the attack on Black Tooth by Alfa Company, 1 NAGA during
OPERATION VIJAY. The National Highway was dominated by a vertical cliff with strong
defences, thus it needed to be removed as soon as possible. The hostile terrain had caused a
temporary halt to the offensive. The feature needed to be secured using a rope. Indifferent to his
own safety, Sepoy K Ashuli offered to perform the risky task. He clung to tiny crevices on the cliffand carefully ascended, braving the terrifying odds of hostile fire and the environment. His
fortitude and tenacity set the example for the business to follow. He successfully kept the enemy
engaged after reaching the summit, and he and his comrades then attacked and seized the enemy
sangar at Black Tooth. He suffered severe injuries as a result of his valiant deed, and passed away
from his wounds on 23 July 1999.

During OPERATION VIJAY, Sepoy K Ashuli was part of Alfa Company, 1 NAGA attacking
Black Tooth in the Drass Sector. A sheer cliff with well-fortified defences dominated the National
Highway and was required to be cleared at the earliest. The enemy had occupied these well-
coordinated defences of sangars with automatic weapons. The attack had been temporarily stalled
due to the inhospitable terrain.
A rope was required to be fixed on to the feature. Sepoy K Ashuli volunteered to do the daring
task unmindful of personal safety. Braving fearful odds of enemy fire and terrain, he clung to mere
cracks onto the cliff and slowly made his way up. His strength and courage shaped the way for the
company to follow. On reaching the top, he effectively kept the enemy engaged and along with his
comrades assaulted the enemy sangar at Black Tooth and captured it. In this brave action, he was
grievously injured. He later succumbed to his injuries on 23 July 1999.
Sepoy K Ashuli displayed nerves of steel, exemplary courage, fearlessness under enemy fire and
camaraderie of the highest order in keeping with the finest traditions of the Indian Army.

2892944,Rifleman,Jai Ram Singh,2 RAJ RIF,"Rifleman Jai Ram Singh was born on 01 March 1978 in Dabla Village of Sikar District in
Rajasthan. After completing his schooling from Govt Senior Secondary School, Dabla, Sikar, he
was enrolled in 2 RAJ RIF of Indian Army on 25 February 1997. During the Kargil War, he was
part of an attack on Lone Hill in in the Drass Sector on 28 June 1999, where he displayed gallantry,
courage and utmost devotion beyond the call of duty in the face of enemy. He was awarded Vir
Chakra for his bravery.
The RAJPUTANA RIFLES is the senior most Rifle Regiment of the Indian Army. Its first
battalion was raised in January 1775. The RAJPUTANA RIFLES has a long and glorious history.
The regiment took part in some of the bloodiest battles in many theatres of the world. During
World War II, the battalions of this regiment fought in every theatre in which the Indian Army was
involved. Three of them, the 1st, 4th and Medium Machine Gun Battalions fought in Eritrea in
North Africa and Italy as part of the famous 4th Indian Division, whose fighting record was one of
the finest in World War II. Post-independence the Regiment took part in many battles and
operations including the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Congo. The RAJPUTANA RIFLES fought
gallantly in the 1965 and 1971 India-Pakistan wars. During the Kargil War, the RAJPUTANA
RIFLES displayed exemplary valour and determination especially in the Tololing Operation. The
2 RAJ RIF was conferred India’s first ‘Instant Unit","’ by General VP Malik, the then Chief
of the Army Staff. During the Kargil War, the men of this regiment displayed exceptional bravery
and fortitude in the capture of Tololing Heights.
The Kargil War of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict
can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan are the
attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. The war
commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the Pakistan army
surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is thought to be the
brain-child of General Pervez Musharraf, then Chief of the Pakistan Army. On 03 May 1999,
intrusions were detected. On 26 May, the first air to ground strike was launched by the Indian
Airforce (IAF), followed by Operation Vijay, by the Indian Army to evict the intruders from the
Indian territory. After two months of violent confrontation, the war came to an end on 26 July
1999.
The Tololing Heights was the deepest penetration beyond the LC by the Pakistani intruders. As
the Kargil War progressed, the capture of Tololing became essential to flush out the Pakistani
intruders. 56 Mountain Brigade was given the task to capture Tololing. Tololing and another
feature named Point 4590 were among the vital peaks for India. Both the peaks were crucial as
they overlooked the Dras Sector and a large section of National Highway, giving enemy a visual
access to every movement on the National Highway. The intruders at the Tololing top stayed putand didn’t open fire until they were discovered on 12 May 1999. This time was utilized by the
intruders to build coordinated defences that would enable the enemy to bring effective fire on
attacking troops. It was imperative for the Indian Army to clear the enemy from these features to
secure the highway.

On 22 May 1999, 18 GRENADIERS launched their first attack on the Tololing top. The battalion
made several attempts and were able to encircle them in the span of two weeks. During the attempts
to recapture the Tololing Top, 18 GRENADIERS also lost a valiant officer Major Rajesh Singh
Adhikari on 30 May 1999. The responsibility to capture the Top was then assigned to 2
RAJPUTANA RIFLES, a Battalion which operated in the valley and had undergone extensive
training at the Corps Battle School in Khrew. 2 RAJ RIF reached Dras Sector on 01 June 1999.To recapture the Tololing Top and the surrounding features, a multi-directional attack plan was
approved by Major General (later Lieutenant General) Mohinder Puri, General Officer
Commanding 8 Mountain Division.
After successful eviction of enemy from Tololing on the eventful night of 12-13 June 1999, the 2
RAJPUTANA RIFLES was tasked to capture Area Three Pimples Complex in the Dras Sector. It
is a cluster of sharp conical features in close proximity to each other between Sando and Tololing
Nullahs and comprises of Knoll, Three Pimples and Lone Hill. Lieutenant Colonel MB
Ravindranath, the Commanding Officer of the 2 RAJPUTANA RIFLES sent out patrols to recce
the area before the attack was launched. Based on the information from the patrols, it was decided
that the best approach to attack Three Pimples was from the South-East direction. Major Mohit
Saxena led the Delta Company tasked to capture Lone Hill which were surrounded by the enemy’s
MMG.

IC-21975,Major (then Captain),Gopa kumar Raman Pillai,9 MADRAS,"Captain Gopa Kumar Raman Pillai was born on 24 October 1941, to CK Raman Pillai, in
Trivandrum District of Kerala. He is an alumnus of the SMV High School, the Government Arts
College, and the Mar Ivanios College. Captain Gopa Kumar Raman Pillai was commissioned
into the Madras Regiment on 03 May 1964 as an Emergency Commissioned Officer (EMO).
Captain Gopakumar was married to Geetha Gopa Kumar Raman Pillai and they had two
children: a son named Colonel Sanjay Gopa Kumar and a daughter named Sanjini Menon.
Colonel Sanjay Gopakumar followed in his father's footsteps and joined the Indian Army. He
was commissioned into the same Battalion, 9 MADRAS, and eventually commanded the
Regiment in 2014.
The origin of the MADRAS Regiment in its present form can be traced to the time when the
Levis were organised into companies of 100 men each, and two Battalions were thus raised on 4
December 1758 and placed under the command of Lord Robert Clive to defend Fort St. George
at Madras. Thus, the Madras Regiment is one of the oldest Regiments of the Indian Infantry.
The Regiment recruits its soldiers from the five Southern states – Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra
Pradesh, Telangana, and Karnataka. The valour of the Madras Regiment was seen when it
fought fierce battles during most military operations of independent India. Their regimental war
cry is “Veer madrassi, adi kollu, adi kollu, adi kollu '' meaning “O brave Madrassi, hit and
kill, hit and kill, hit and kill.” The MADRAS Regimental Centre is located at Wellington in
the Nilgiris District, Tamil Nadu. In its glorious 265 Years of its existence, the Regiment has a
total 45 Battle Honours, 14 Theatre Honours, 11 COAS unit","s, 52 GOC-in-C Unit
Appreciations, 5 UN Force Commander Citations, 01 Ashoka Chakra, 5 Mahavir Chakra, 11
Kirti Chakra, 36 Vir Chakra, 49 Shaurya Chakra, and many other gallantry & distinguished
awards.
India gained Independence in 1947, and the partition resulted in the creation of Pakistan. The
foundation of Pakistan was laid by the Muslim League based on the two-nation theory. Pakistan
comprised two wings- East and West Pakistan which were geographically separated by 1600
kms Indian territory. The two wings of Pakistan were culturally and linguistically different and
the diversities between the two wings could not be bridged by an emotional appeal to religion.
Consequently, fissures started erupting in the political body of Pakistan soon after the
Independence and with each passing year it widened. In the absence of appropriate defence
arrangements, the people of East Pakistan felt isolated and abandoned. Finally, the malfeasance
of Pakistani leadership during Cyclone Bhola and the overwhelming support for the Awami
League in the 1970 elections, proved the proverbial last straw on the camel’s back.2 The Awami
League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (of East Pakistan) secured an absolute majority in the
general elections held in December 1970. This entitled the League to form a Government in
Pakistan. However, Pakistan’s military rulers denied this democratic right to the Awami
League, in connivance with the PPP, led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. This arbitrary act of
government caused deep resentment among the population of East Pakistan resulting in
widespread protests. When the slide became unmanageable, the Pakistani rulers resorted to a
midnight crackdown on 25 March 1971. The government ordered a military crackdown and the
Pakistan army under Lieutenant General Tikka Khan unleashed a reign of terror and massacred
thousands of Bengalis in a genocide codenamed ‘Operation Searchlight’. Pakistan launched its
attack against India on 03 December 1971. The Indo-Pak War of 1971 was the first war when
the Indian Government engaged all three services on a large scale.During the war, 9 MADRAS was located in Barmer (Rajasthan) in August 1971 as part of 330
Infantry Brigade of 11 Infantry Division. The Brigade was assigned the task of launching Phase
1 of the Division attack on Naya Chor (West Pakistan). In the first week of November, the
Battalion found itself concentrated at Chohtan. The Battalion was given the following tasks: to
act as Division reserve during the initial build up and protect the border from Gadra Road to
Munabao, to assist 31 Infantry Brigade in the capture of Gadra City, and later be part of 85
Infantry Brigade, in the capture of Khokhropar; and on reversion to 330 Infantry Brigade, to
form part of the deliberate attack on Naya Chor.
On the night of 02/03 December, 9 MADRAS moved from Chohtan into Company localities
along the axis Gadra-Munabao. Patrolling and protection of the border were undertaken. On 04
December, the Battalion crossed the border. Both 31 and 85 Infantry Brigades quickly
overwhelmed the enemy and captured Khokropar and Gadra City. The Battalion was then
tasked to defend Khokhropar against an expected enemy counterattack, and it began to dig in on
05 December.
On the following day, the Battalion was ordered to advance and capture Mahendro Ro Par and
Fateh Ro Par on the Gadra City-Umraokot axis. 31 Infantry Brigade was advancing from the
direction of Gadra City and Pirani Ka Par with another Battalion of the Regiment, 18
MADRAS, in the lead. 9 MADRAS was to link up with the sister Battalion at Mahendro Ro
Par, and it advanced on a man-pack basis. The enemy withdrew in haste, and 9 MADRAS
secured both the places. However, the link-up did not materialise as 18 MADRAS could not
arrive till 1300 hours on 07 December, and 9 MADRAS was ordered to get on to the main axis
and concentrate at Bhitala.
The Battalion split into two groups: one proceeded to Bhitala and the other moved back to
Khokhropar to fetch the vehicular column bogged down there in the sand. This group joined the
Battalion at Bhitala at 1000 hours on 08 December. By then 11 Infantry Division had advanced
upto Sakhna. 330 Infanry Brigade leap-frogged on Vasarbh and was given the job of
constructing tracks and ferrying bogged-down vehicles of the Division column forward. The
same day 85 Infantry Brigade contacted the enemy Screen Position and in a frontal attack
cleared it. 9 MADRAS then sent a deep penetration patrol to Khat Singh. During the night of
13/14 December, 85 Infantry Brigade captured Parbat Ali, a salient of great tactical
significance; and the Brigade had to ward off several determined counterattacks to secure it.
9 MADRAS and 330 Infantry Brigade had by then reached West of Point 315 which was
strongly held. But the Division ran short of artillery ammunition expended during the attack on
Parbat Ali and the counterattacks, and the next attack had to wait. Stocking of ammunition was
slow because of the terrain and interfering enemy air sorties.Major Gopa Kumar Raman Pillai with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi

Meanwhile the cease fire was announced on 17 December 1971, and all operations came to a
standstill. During the Operations the Battalion suffered 10 casualties-2 killed, 8 wounded.
Captain Gopa Kumar Raman Pillai, of 9 MADRAS, was awarded the Vir Chakra for organising
a mixed group of personnel into a highly motivated and effective team by his zeal, boundless
energy and hard work. Through his leadership, they became a highly driven and efficient unit.
He skillfully led them through a series of daring and brave maneuvers against the adversary in
the Eastern Sector, including the capture of a heavily fortified enemy stronghold.

village of Mirpur District in present day Pakistan. After partition his family settled in
Ramgarh District of Jammu and Kashmir. Second Lieutenant Bahadur Singh did his schooling
from Government High School Ramgarh in Jammu and Kashmir. Later, he joined the Army at
the age of 24 years on 14 June 1970. He was Commissioned into 10 SIKH LI of the Sikh
Light Infantry Regiment, an Infantry Regiment known for its brave soldiers and rich history
of various battle honours. Very early in his service career, he got involved in the thick of
operations as border tension arose with Pakistan in 1971.
The Sikh Light Infantry previously known as the Mazabhi and Ramdasia Sikh Regiment is a
Regiment of the Indian Army. Its name was changed to the Sikh Light Infantry in 1944. The
Sikh Light Infantry inherited the battle honours, colours and traditions of the Mazabhi Sikh
Pioneers on its merging with a few Ramdasia Companies in 1941. After serving under the
British Raj for nearly a century they distinguished themselves with loyalty to the British
Crown and Empire in numerous conflicts in and around the Indian Subcontinent including
both the First World War and the Second World War. The Sikh Light Infantry has displayed
immense versatility as the regiment conducted operations from Siachen Glacier to
counterterrorism. The regimental motto is Deg Tegh Fateh, meaning prosperity in peace and
victory in war. During the Indo-Pak War of 1971, 8 SIKH LI was awarded the Battle Honour
“Fatehpur” for displaying exemplary courage and fortitude. The Regiment has given the
Indian Army three Chiefs - General Ved Prakash Malik PVSM, AVSM who was the 19th
Army Chief, General Bikram Singh PVSM, UYSM, AVSM, SM, VSM, who was the 24th
Army Chief and General Manoj Mukund Naravane PVSM, AVSM, SM, VSM, who was the
28th Army Chief and retired on 30th April 2022.
The 1971 War was a military conflict between India and Pakistan during the Bangladesh
Liberation War from 03 to 16 December 1971. It began with preemptive airstrikes by the
Pakistan Air Force on Indian targets, leading to India’s involvement in support of Bengali
nationalist forces. Pakistan suffered a significant defeat in this War. The Indo-Pak War of
1971 was the first war when the Indian Government engaged all three services on a large
scale. A total of 4,090 Indian soldiers made the supreme sacrifice during this war and about
600 officers and men of the Indian Armed Forces were decorated with Gallantry awards. Of
these, 04 were Param Vir Chakra, 76 Maha Vir Chakra and 513 Vir Chakra.
On the night of 04/05 December 1971, 11 Infantry Division launched a three-pronged
offensive to capture Pakistani territory up to Naya Chor. The axes of thrust were as follows:
• Northern Axis — Mithrau – Mankau – Saidau – Relnor – Kitlor – Jamo.
• Central Axis — Astride the railway line and track running west from Munabao to Naya
Chor.
• Southern Axis — Gadra Road – Gadra City – Pirani ka Par – Dali – Bagal and Kelnor –
Bhame ka Tar – Khimsar.
The Division launched its main thrust, on the Munabao-Parbat Ali Naya Chor axis. The IAF
carried out strikes on the Gazi Camp, Kajlor and Khokhropar on the evening of 04 December,
to facilitate the Divisional task. 85 Infantry Brigade, under Brigadier Gurjeet Randhawa
captured Gazi Camp and Kajlor on the night of 04/05 December and Bhitala and Khokhroparthe next morning. The defenders offered light opposition and withdrew leaving behind a large
quantity of ammunition.
But now the Brigade faced problems of communication. The track beyond Khokhropar was in
poor condition and Bhitala onwards it was worse. The railway line was found to be in good
shape, but there was no rolling stock at the Khokhropar Railway Station. Therefore, a
duckboard track had to be constructed from Munabao to Khokhropar for administrative
support. These obstacles slowed down the advance of the Brigade.
However, by 1400 hours on 06 December, the area Vasarabh-Sakna had been secured. On 07
December, 10 SIKH LI advancing along the railway line, occupied Jalu Jo Chaunro by 0500
hours and Parche Ji Vari area by 1000 hours. Then advancing South of the railway line on the
Vasarabh-Parche Ji Vari-Naya Chor axis they secured about 900 metre area to the South-East
of Parche Ji Vari by 1300 hours. 2 MAHAR, which had secured the Vasarabh Railway
Station, then advanced along the railway line and firmed in at Parche Ji Vari Railway Station
by 1500 hours. During the day, PAF strafed and bombed the 85 Infantry Brigade four times.
The IAF also flew four strike missions over the Naya Chor area. The Brigade reached the
vicinity of Naya Chor by 0800 hours on 08 December and established contact with the
defenders in the Apex area, which was the Screen Position of the main Pak defences. 10 SIKH
and 2 MAHAR attacked the Apex position at 0135 hours on 11 December. But the Pakistanis
pulled back to Parbat Ali, which was strongly held by one Infantry Battalion with at least ten
MMGs. As Parbat Ali dominated both the railway line and the main tracks to Naya Chor, it
had been built up into a formidable position for the defence of Naya Chor. It was protected by
a minefield with a depth of 550 to 730 metres and by wire obstacles laid in front of the
forward localities.
It was decided to launch a Brigade level attack against Parbat Ali. It was to be carried out by 2
MAHAR and 10 SIKH, while 10 SIKH LI and 2 RAJPUTANA RIFLES were to provide
them a firm base and simulate attacks from other directions. 3 (Independent) Armoured
Squadron was to provide antitank cover and simulate an outflanking move on the left. The
assaulting Battalions were provided with one Medium and three Field Batteries each. 78 Field
Company was to breach the minefield and create a vehicle lane from Apex to Parbat Ali.A still from the Battle of Parbat Ali
https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=313400768856559&set=pcb.313400808856555
The attack, preceded by a ten-minute barrage of artillery fire, was launched at 0300 hours on
13 December, from an unexpected direction that involved a difficult climb of 80 degrees. The
assaulting Companies neared the objective at 0745 hours and came under MMG and small
arms fire only after they had reached close to the forward localities. The Pakistanis could not
use artillery or mortar fire to prevent the assault as the attacking troops closed in. Still, they
offered stiff resistance. Both, 2 MAHAR and 10 SIKH mopped up the defenders from trench
to trench and finally captured the objective by 1000 hours on 13 December, after hand-to-
hand fighting.
The Pakistani troops then launched three successive counterattacks, which were beaten back.
They left behind 57 dead, and 35 POWs. 85 Infantry Brigade continued their effort to close up
on Naya Chor. Meanwhile, the duck board track had been constructed up to 9.5 km from
Khokhropar.
On 14 December, 10 SIKH LI was tasked to capture Parche Jiveri village (now called
Bahadur Nagar) as part of ongoing operations. As planned, the Battalion launched its attack in
the night of 14 December. The assaulting Companies ran into a mine field and Maj Arora of
the Battalion got severally wounded. Second Lieutenant Bahadur Singh under the leadership
of his Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Basant Singh then spearheaded a daring
attack against a stiff opposition from the main defences of ‘Parbat Ali’ on the out skirts of
‘Naya Chor’ (Sindh).Battle of Parbat Ali

bunkers and high density mine fields. It was occupied by 21 Frontier Force of Pakistani Army
and was very crucial to the overall objective of Indian Army in that Sector. On 15 December
1971, Second Lieutenant Bahadur Singh along with his comrades was tasked to capture the
enemy defence position at ‘Parabat Ali’. In this attack, the assaulting troops came under
heavy artillery and Medium Machine Gun fire and suffered casualties. Second Lieutenant
Bahadur Singh noticed an enemy Medium Machine Gun firing from a bunker on a flank.
Realizing the importance of silencing this gun, he sensed that the enemy MMG had to be
silenced at any cost. He then in a daring move led a charge on this Post without caring for his
own safety. He managed to silence the gun but while doing so, was hit by a burst of the
medium machine gun fire. He later succumbed to his injuries and was martyred. 10 SIKH LI
secured the Parche Ji Vari village area by 0530 hours on 15 December and cleared the Six
Trees area by 1100 hours. This brought them close to enemy defences, which were protected
by extensive minefields. Pakistanis made two counterattacks with infantry and armour, but the
Sikhs beat them back.Source: https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=4795531820513891&set=gm.2281295415346478
Subsequently, the Sikhs withdrew to Parche Ji Vari village as the Six Trees position was
dominated by the enemy. The Division had by now over-stretched itself and a decision was
made to put in a more concentrated effort after a proper build up. But the ceasefire intervened
before the build-up could take place.
Second Lieutenant Bahadur Singh was a gallant soldier and a gritty officer, who led from the
front and laid down his life at the age of 26 years in the line of his duty. Second Lieutenant
Bahadur Singh was awarded Vir Chakra for his courageous action, leadership and sacrifice.","Second Lieutenant Bahadur Singh (IC-24250)

Uttarakhand (then Uttaranchal). His parent’s name was Hukam Singh Rawat and Kamla Devi. He
enrolled in 18 GARHWAL RIFLES of Indian Army on 25 October, 1994, at the age of 20. During
the Kargil War in 1999, Rifleman Kuldeep Singh displayed outstanding bravery, rare courage and
sacrificed himself for the nation and was awarded Vir Chakra posthumously for displaying
gallantry of high order.
The GARHWAL RIFLES is a light infantry or rifle regiment of the Indian Army. It came into
existence on 05 May 1887 at the instance of Field Marshal Sir FS Roberts, the then Command-in-
Chief of India. Lieutenant Colonel EP Mainwaring raised the First battalion at Almora on 05 May
1887 and moved it to Kaludanda (later renamed as Lansdowne after the then Viceroy of India) on
04 November 1887. The Regimental Centre was established at Lansdowne on 01 October 1921.
During the First World War, the GARHWAL RIFLES were involved in the trench warfare and
fought gallantly earning many bravery awards. The GARHWAL RIFLES received the rare honour
of being conferred with the ‘Royal’ title which was made official on 02 February 1921. The
regiment also fought during the World War II and after the independence was transferred to the
union of India. Post-independence the GARHWAL RIFLES have fought in the 1962 India-China
War, 1965 and 1971 India-Pakistan Wars. During the Kargil War, the 18 GARHWAL RIFLES
fought in the heights of Point 5140 and Point 4700 in the Drass sector and received the “Unit","”.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and
Kashmir by any means. The Kargil war of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The war
commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the Pakistan army
surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is thought to be the
brain-child of General Pervez Musharraf, then chief of the Pakistan Army. On 03 May 1999,
intrusions were detected. On 26 May1, the first air to ground strike was launched by the Indian
Airforce (IAF), followed by OPERATION VIJAY, by the Indian Army to evict the intruders from
the Indian territory2. After two months of violent confrontation, the war came to an end on 26 July
1999.

The rugged hill tops in Drass sector had specific features which provided dominating viewpoints
of the National Highway 1 Alpha. The intruders from Pakistan had formed a well-coordinated
defensive layout along those features. It was imperative for the Indian Army to clear the enemy
from these features to secure the highway. One such feature was Point 4700, a ridgeline on the
west of Pt 5140 and east of Tololing Nala. This feature was very crucial as the intruders has
occupied this location after being evicted from Tololing and Point 5140. The task to clear Point
4700 was given to the 18 Garhwal Rifles. Colonel SK Chakravarty, the Commanding Officer of
the unit completed his reconnaissance and gave orders to attack. The A Company secured the firm
base and the F echelon (the fighting troops) moved forward on the night of 27-28 June 1999. The
C and D company under Major Rajesh Sah and Major SK Joshi respectively and reached 300 to
400 meters of their objective without major opposition from the enemy.
On June 28, 1999, Rifleman Kuldeep Singh was assigned to Charlie Company's leading Section,
which was charged with capturing a target at Point 4700 in the Drass sector during OPERATION
VIJAY. With eight sangars firing automatic guns, the target was well-defended. The leading
Section came under heavy automatic fire from a nearby sangar as it approached the objective.
Rifleman Kuldeep Singh moved through boulders from the left flank to neutralise the sangar,
oblivious to his own safety. A gunshot struck him in the leg. He continued to advance, bleedingheavily and unconcerned about the impending danger, shooting his rifle from the hip and yelling
the war cry. When the enemy saw this strong and decisive action, they fled the sangar and began
firing indiscriminately. Rifleman Kuldeep Singh killed three attackers and injured two more during
the firefight. During the firefight, however, he was shot in the head by a bullet and died on the spot
from his injuries.

Army were raised. The Field Regiments support the formations on the field. The regimental

(Pg no 104-105)Major Prabhu Nath Prasad, SM, of 32 R&O Flight (663 R&O Squadron) was flying an aerial
reconnaissance mission to locate intrusions in the Drass Sub-Sector on 13 May 1999. On spotting
a foot track coming in from across the LoC, the officer flew low and followed it up to a mountain
feature called Black Rock (14,700 feet) adjacent to Tololing. Suddenly, Major Prasad and his co-
pilot discovered that they were less than 300 metres away from a group of 15 to 20 Pakistani
intruders who were rapidly closing in. Even as Major Prasad began to turn away, the intruders
fired a rocket at the helicopter. Major Prasad instinctively dipped the nose of the helicopter,
increasing the helicopter's speed almost instantaneously. This evasive maneuver due to reflex
action caused the rocket to miss the helicopter by 10 to 15 metres. Displaying exceptional presence
of mind and superb flying skills, he succeeded in flying the helicopter out of harm's way and
immediately called for artillery fire on the intruders' location. Though the enemy continued to fire
at him with machine guns and an armed Puma helicopter of Pakistan also joined the fray, Major
Prasad skillfully controlled the fire of 155 mm Bofors guns and ensured that about 40 shells landed
on the enemy position, killing seven to 10 intruders. This close- range reconnaissance proved
extremely useful in fixing the forward positions of the intruders and inflicting casualties on them.
For his masterly flying under fire, professional excellence and conspicuous courage beyond the
call of duty, Major Prabhu Nath Prasad, SM, was awarded the Vir Chakra.CITATION

While on an aerial reconnaissance mission to locate intrusion in Drass Sub-Sector on 13 May 1999,
Major Prabhu Nath Prasad, as captain of the helicopter, taking clue from a foot -track on snow
coming in from across the LOC, he, in a daredevil venture, followed it to the black rock feature at
a height of about 14,700 feet adjacent to the TOLOLING height against heavy enemy machine
gun fire. No sooner he had closed in while orbiting, and was in the eyeball contact with 15 to 20
intruders, then they fired a rocket at the helicopter when it was barely 300 metres away
Major Prabhu Nath Prasad with his unparalleled reflex action, undaunted courage and grit,
instantly dipped the helicopter nose down and with that appreciable increase in speed out
manoeuvred the rocket which went past the tail of the helicopter missing it just by 10-15 metres.
Displaying exceptional presence of mind and tactful flying skill, he immediately turned the
helicopter with a steep back in the reciprocal direction to get out of the killing ground/airspace and
flew back to immediately call for artillery fire.
The officer brought in accurate artillery fire of 40 rounds from Bofors guns despite continuously
being engaged by machine gun fire from enemy position at Tololing and interference by an armed
PUMA helicopter of the enemy which intruded overhead during the Air shoot, Major Prabhu Nath
Prasad neutralised/destroyed the enemy position killing 7-10 intruders within just 20-25 minutes
of the rocket attack. Having suffered this great loss, the intruders had abandoned the feature by
the next day.
Major Prabhu Nath Prasad, thus, showed exemplary courage and dedication beyond the call of
duty in the presence of the enemy.

be traced back to the sepoy battalions raised in 1775 by Lord Clive for British East India Company
at Patna. The Bihar Regiment was formally raised in the year 1941 by regularising the 11
(Territorial) Battalion, 19 Hyderabad Regiment and raising new battalions. Despite being among
the youngest, it has displayed exemplary valour and strength on various occasions. Their
participation in World War II, Indo-Pak 1965 and 1971 is regarded highly in the annals of history
of the Indian Army. 1 BIHAR participated in Operation Vijay in the Batalik Sub Sector and was
responsible for recapture of Jubar Hill and Tharu. For its valour, the unit was honoured with Chief

In a Brigade level operation of 70 Infantry Brigade, 1 BIHAR was given the task of recapturing
the Jubar complex. 17 GARHWAL RIFLES, having already established strongholds, was to
simultaneously assault and recapture Area Bumps and Kalapathar and, subsequently, exploit up to
Point 5285 at the junction of the Jubar and Kukarthang features. Initially, only holding attacks
were planned to be launched to draw the enemy's attention away from the main weight of the
brigade attack on the Khalubar ridgeline. Subsequently, after success had been achieved on the
Khalubar ridgeline and the enemy's maintenance routes were effectively interdicted, the full weight
of the brigade attack was shifted to the Jubar, Tharu and Kukarthang complexes. 'B' and 'C'
Companies of 1 BIHAR launched the attack on the night of 29-30 June 1999. Phase 1 of the attack
went as planned and Jubar OP was captured by first light on 30 June 1999 after a gallant rush to
the top by the troops of 1 BIHAR, who refused to be daunted by withering fire from a large number
of automatics from several directions. The troops of 1 BIHAR fell upon the enemy amid cries of
""Jai Bajrang Bali"" and drove the Pakistanis out from their sangars on Jubar OP. A counter-attack
by the enemy was repulsed, with heavy casualties. However, Jubar Top proved to be a tough nut
to crack. Heavy exchange of fire continued between the contending troops throughout the next day
and resulted in a large number of casualties on both sides.
Another attempt to capture Jubar Top on the night of 30 June- 01 July 1999 with a fresh Company
was unsuccessful. The stand-off lasted five days. During this time, the brigade's energies were
concentrated on the grim struggle being waged by 1/11 GORKHA RIFLES on Khalubar. However,
the enemy holding out on Jubar was given right royal treatment by the Artillery during pauses inthe attack on Khalubar and when artillery firing had to be withheld due to proximity of own troops.
The infantry mortars joined in and continued to engage targets within range throughout. Air strikes
were also planned and executed when the weather permitted. Fortuitously, the enemy's
ammunition dump behind Jubar Main was hit by the fire of artillery guns and the infantry mortars
of 1 BIHAR, and blew up completely. Five days of almost continuous pulverisation by a large
number of guns took its toll and the enemy's morale was in the boots after the ammunition dump
was hit. Apparently in panic, the enemy was observed thinning out from Jubar Top.
In order to exploit the situation, a fresh attack was launched on the night of 06-07 July 1999. Major
KPR Hari, one of the Company Commanders, led a two-pronged attack under heavy enemy
artillery and small arms fire. Along with six men, Major Hari crawled through the boulders and
scaled a steep cliff face leading to Jubar Top from an unexpected direction. They reached
undetected within 50 meters of the enemy's position. In a bold and awe-inspiring charge, these
gallant soldiers of 1 BIHAR fell upon the unsuspecting enemy, continuously firing their assault
rifles and lobbing grenades. With utter disregard for his personal safety, Major Hari attacked an
HMG sangar and killed two enemy personnel. The HMG that was holding up the attack having
been silenced, the rest of his company soon reached the objective and captured it by 0500 hours
without any casualty. Those of the enemy soldiers who were able to withdraw, did so, leaving
behind the dead bodies of their colleagues. Then, along with another officer, Major Hari kept up
the momentum of the attack and went on to lead his troops to capture Jubar Main by 1800 hours.
For taking the initiative and displaying boldness of the highest order and for his courageous and
exceptional leadership, Major K P R Hari was awarded Vir Chakra.

The Corps of Engineers is one of the oldest arms of the Indian Army. The origin of the Corps
dates back to 1780 when the two regular pioneer companies were raised in the Madras
Presidency Army. Subsequently, the Group of Madras, Bengal and Bombay Sappers were
formed in their respective presidencies. These Groups came together when the British Indian
Army was formed after 1857 and were later merged on 18 November 1932 to form the Corps of
Indian Engineers. Engineer Groups initially consisted of field companies (a sub-unit organisation
that exists to this day). Till 1911, the Sappers also had the duty of passing battlefield messages.
Between 1911 and 1920, they handed this task to a batch of their own kinsmen who then formed
the Corps of Signals. The Sappers also contributed the first batch of airmen when the Indian Air
Force was raised in 1932. From 1942-1945 officers of the Indian Railways were recruited into
this Corps to participate in Britain's Burma Campaign. The present Chief of the Army Staff

The Sikh Regiment is one of the highest decorated regiments of the Indian Army. It came into
existence on 01 August 1846, with the raising of Regiment of Ferozepore Sikhs and Regiment of
Ludhiana Sikhs by Captain G Tebbs and Lieutenant Colonel P Gordon respectively. They
participated effectively in the 1857 First War of Independence. This war proved to be beneficial
for the Sikhs as it revealed their valour and fighting tenacity. Under the British Indian Army, the
Sikh Regiment fought gallantly in a number of war and battles including the Battle of Saragarhi in
which they left an indelible mark in the regiment’s history. By 1914 the Sikh Regiment was
deployed as part of British Indian Army for operations in World War I. The modern Sikh Regiment
traces its roots directly from the 11th Sikh Regiment of the British Indian Army. When transferred
to the Indian Army post-Independence, the numeral 11 was removed and new battalions were
added.3 The Regiment has served in all theatres of operations and earned 28 battle honours. They
have also won two PVC’s; Lance Naik Karam Singh in Tithwal, Jammu & Kashmir in 1948 and
Subedar Joginder Singh in October 1962 in Tawang Sector of Arunachal Pradesh.

observed moving along the ridgeline to the west of the pass. In an effort to outdo the Pakistaniarmy, the 14 SIKH received orders to capture Point 5310, a strategic location at an elevation of
17,500 feet, which dominated the areas to the north and west of the ridgeline.
Lieutenant Praveen Kumar along with Ghatak Platoon of 14 Sikh were given the order to capture
Point 5310 in the Chorbat La Sector on 15 July, 1999. Point 5310 was located three kilometers
deep inside the enemy territory. It was appreciated that if this dominating feature, located in
between Chorbat La and Turtuk Sectors, was captured and secured, it will cut off the maintenance
route to enemy positions opposite Turtuk Sector and also improve the defensive posture and if held
may strengthen the LC between Chorbat La and Turtuk Sectors. In preparation for taking Point
5310 via surprise attack, Lieutenant Praveen Kumar divided his Ghatak Platoon into three Squads
and conducted numerous drills on dummy features. He instructed the Ghatak Platoon in cliff
assault, mountain climbing, ice-craft, and glaciated operations tactics after recently completing a
mountain warfare training with instructor Grading. He and two other guys crossed the LoC on 20
July, 1999, conducted thorough reconnaissance of the feature, and chose three potential methods
for the surprise attack.
The Ghataks passed the LoC around 2100 hours on 22 July, 1999, following final preparations,
and they started their approach to Point 5310. To get to the base of Point 5310, the first group, led
by Lieutenant Praveen Kumar carried out the cliff assault after fixing 250 metre of rope and
reached the top and totally surprised the enemy. Thereafter, the second group led by Naik Raghbir
Singh also reached the top. The third group, led by Naib Subedar Satnam Singh, unable to scale
the feature from designated direction of approach, was diverted to the firm base that was converted
into the administrative base.
The final push to the objective took the enemy completely by surprise as the enemy discovered the presence
of the Sikhs only the next morning. Thereafter, Lieutenant Praveen Kumar organized his defences,
sited automatic weapons and organized Point 5310 into a formidable defensive position.
Subsequently, he successfully destroyed four sangars of the enemy, and a small fuel and
ammunition dump and killed fifteen of the enemy men by small arms and by directing artillery
and mortar fire along his route of maintenance opposite Turtuk Sector.
Throughout the action, Lieutenant Praveen Kumar displayed professional competence, leading to
the capture of the objective without any casualty. This operation improved our defensive posture
in Chorbat La sector and effectively disrupting and cutting off the enemy's line of
maintenance. Lieutenant Praveen Kumar was awarded Vir Chakra for his immense courage and
gallantry in the face of enemy.","IC-57455 Lieutenant Praveen Kumar 14 SIKH REGIMENT

On 15 July 1999, Lieutenant Praveen Kumar along with Ghatak Platoon of 14 Sikh Regiment was
ordered to capture Point 5310 in Chorbatla sector during ""Operation Vijay”. Point 5310 was
located three kilometer deep inside the enemy territory. It was appreciated that if this dominating
feature, located in between Chorbatla and Turtuk Sectors, was captured and secured, it will cut off
the maintenance route to enemy positions opposite Turtuk Sector and also improve the defensive

Lieutenant Praveen Kumar organized his Ghatak Platoon in three groups and carried out several
rehearsals on mock features for capturing Point 5310 by surprise attack. He being recently
qualified on mountain warfare course with instructor grading trained the Ghatak Platoon in cliff
assault, mountain climbing, ice-craft and techniques of glaciated operations. On 20 July 1999, he
along with two men crossed the LC and carried out detailed reconnaissance of the feature and
selected three different approaches for the surprise attack.
On 22 July 1999, after final rehearsals, the Ghataks crossed the LC at 2100 hrs and began their
approach to Point 5310. The first group led by Lieutenant Praveen Kumar negotiated the ice-wall
almost 300 metre high, crossed a glaciated bowl and a Number of crevasses to reach the base of
Point 5310. On reaching the base of the objective, he secured the Ghatak base. Thereafter, as
planned, the three groups commenced the silent attack from three designated directions. The group
led by Lieutenant Praveen Kumar carried out the cliff assault after fixing 250 metre of rope and
reached the top and totally surprised the enemy. Thereafter, the second group led by Naik Raghbir
Singh also reached the top. The third group, led by Naib Subedar Satnam Singh, unable to scale

The SIKH Regiment is one of the highest decorated regiments of the Indian Army. It came into
existence on 01 August 1846, with the raising of Regiment of Ferozepore Sikhs and Regiment of
Ludhiana Sikhs by Captain G Tebbs and Lieutenant Colonel P Gordon respectively. They
participated effectively in the 1857 First War of Independence. This war proved to be beneficial
for the Sikhs as it revealed their valour and fighting tenacity. Under the British Indian Army, the
Sikh Regiment fought gallantly in a number of war and battles including the Battle of Saragarhi inwhich they left an indelible mark in the regiment’s history. By 1914 the Sikh Regiment was
deployed as part of British Indian Army for operations in World War I. The Regiment served in
all theatres of operations and earned 28 battle honours. The modern SIKH Regiment traces its roots
directly from the 11th Sikh Regiment of the British Indian Army. When transferred to the Indian
Army post-Independence, the numeral 11 was removed and new battalions were added. Naik
(Later subedar Major & Honorary Captain) Karam Singh of this Regiment was awarded the nations
highest gallantry award the Param Vir Chakra during the battle of Tithwal,in J&K in July 1948.
Subedar Joginder Singh was awarded the Param Vir Chakra during the battle of Tonglen Pa in
Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh in October 1962. Both belonged to 1 SIKH now redesignated as 4
MECHANISED INFANTRY.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and
Kashmir by any means. The Kargil war of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The war
commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the Pakistan army
surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is thought to be the
brain-child of General Pervez Musharraf, then Chief of the Pakistan Army. On 03 May 1999,
intrusions were detected. On 26 May 1, the first air to ground strike was launched by the Indian
Airforce (IAF), followed by Operation Vijay, by the Indian Army to evict the intruders from the
Indian territory2. After two months of violent confrontation, the war came to an end on 26 July
1999.

The Tiger Hill complex is one of the most dominating and awe-inspiring features in the Dras
sector. The Pakistani soldiers who had occupied the Tiger Hill complex in strength were bringing
effective artillery on large tracts of the National Highway 1A. Eviction of the enemy from this
feature was urgent and necessary. The Tiger hill was the key to enemy position in the Dras Sector.
The Tiger Hill Complex was isolated from the North, South and East by 8 SIKH on 21 May 1999.
However, the isolation from the West could not be done as the complete ridge line was occupied
by the enemy. The Indian Army moreover was not permitted to cross the Line of Control to get
behind the enemy to cut his line of communications. To completely isolate the enemy on Tiger
Hill, Colonel Kaushal Thakur the Commanding Officer of 18 GRENADIERS, applied the lessons
learnt earlier at the Tololing and Hump and decided a multidirectional attack, with the majority of
force level assaulting from unexpected direction. The attack on Tiger Hill commenced on 03 July1999 at 2030 hours. By 0400 Hours of 05 July 1999, 18 GRENADIERS and 8 SIKH were able to
capture several important features of Tiger Hill and succeeded in completely isolating the enemy
sitting at the Tiger Hill top.
8 SIKH was inducted into the Dras sub-sector on 14 May 1999 and had cleared Point 4195, Point
4460 and the area around Pariyon ka Talab by 18 May 1999. Since then, 8 SIKH was in contact
with the enemy at Tiger Hill and had contained and prevented further expansion of the enemy's
defences, besides causing substantive attrition. They had isolated Tiger Hill from three directions
and had provided a firm base to 18 GRENADIERS for the attack on Tiger Hill. Simultaneously, 8
SIKH had simulated attacks from the Southern and Northern directions. One company of the
battalion was nominated as reserve. 8 SIKH was now given the task to facilitate the early capture
of Tiger Hill by capturing its Western spur, including Helmet and India Gate, so as to prevent the
reinforcement of Tiger Hill Top. The move was also intended to cut off the enemy's supply route
to Tiger Hill. The Western spur of Tiger Hill extended 1.5 km and was well held. The approach to
it lay along a steep rock face with a gradient of 75 to 80 degrees. Colonel SP Singh, Commanding
Officer of 8 SIKH formed his Ghatak Platoon. Major Ravindra Singh was nominated to lead an ad
hoc column comprising Lieutenant R K Sehrawat, four junior commissioned officers (JCOs) and
52 jawans. In a daring assault on the night of 04-05 July 1999, Major Ravinder Singh’s Column
climbed steadily under withering fire, helped only by the poor visibility caused by dense fog and
pouring rain. The SIKHs established a fire base 200 metres from the objective, neutralised a
machine gun sited on a vantage point and quickly charged uphill to occupy the feature named India
Gate. The dreaded war cry of the SIKH, “Bole So Nihal, Sat Sri Akal”, sent shivers down the
spines of the intruders and cheered the Grinders on the other side.
Subedar Nirmal Singh was leading a small Team to establish a foothold on an objective in Dras
Sub Sector on 05 July 1999. While assaulting, Subedar Nirmal Singh noticed enemy movement.
But before enemy could react, he directed fire of own automatics on enemy and inflicted heavy
casualties. Enemy was forced to retreat. Subedar Nirmal Singh then quickly approached the
objective and captured it. Rest of the Company followed up next day and reorganised defences.
Subedar Nirmal Singh deployed his platoon on a forward slope. At 0600 hours, enemy opened fire
and followed it up with a counter attack on the position held by Subedar Nirmal Singh's men with
15/16 intruders. Heavy hand to hand fight ensued. Subedar Nirmal Singh and his men despite
being seriously wounded, kept fighting the enemy with extreme bravado, courage and continued
fighting till the last man last round. They kept the enemy away till they all succumbed to their fatal
injuries.
During this operation, Subedar Nirmal Singh single handedly took on the enemy, face to face, at
close quarter. He kept motivating troops around him and also led an assault on enemy force torepulse the counter attack. During the action, he made the supreme sacrifice of his life in the

pakistan-surrendered-in-the-indo-pak-war-of-1971/27448)India gained Independence in 1947, and the partition resulted in the creation of Pakistan. The
foundation of Pakistan was laid by the Muslim League based on the two-nation theory. Pakistan
comprised two wings- East and West Pakistan which were geographically separated by 1600
kms Indian territory. The two wings of Pakistan were culturally and linguistically different and
the diversities between the two wings could not be bridged by an emotional appeal to religion.
Consequently, fissures started erupting in the political body of Pakistan soon after the
Independence and with each passing year it widened. In the absence of appropriate defence
arrangements, the people of East Pakistan felt isolated and abandoned. Finally, the malfeasance
of Pakistani leadership during Cyclone Bhola and the overwhelming support for the Awami
League in the 1970 elections, proved the proverbial last straw on the camel’s back.1 The Awami
League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (of East Pakistan) secured an absolute majority in the
general elections held in December 1970. This entitled the League to form a Government in
Pakistan. However, Pakistan’s military rulers denied this democratic right to the Awami
League, in connivance with the PPP, led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. This arbitrary act of
government caused deep resentment among the population of East Pakistan resulting in
widespread protests. When the slide became unmanageable, the Pakistani rulers resorted to a
midnight crackdown on 25 March 1971. The government ordered a military crackdown and
the Pakistan army under Lieutenant General Tikka Khan unleashed a reign of terror and
massacred thousands of Bengalis in a genocide code-named ‘Operation Searchlight’. Pakistan
launched its attack against India on 03 December 1971. The Indo-Pak War of 1971 was the
first war when the Indian Government engaged all three services on a large scale.

points towards the Madhopur Headworks and the Pathankot military base on the further side.
The Southern part rests on the Ravi River, across which lie the Indian cities of Amritsar, Batala
and Gurdaspur. The Bulge is generally flat but criss-crossed by numerous nullahs, viz. Aik,

Infantry Brigade and 14 Horse used the Bridgehead to advance on Nurkot-Shakargarh at 2200
hours on 08 December. The Pakistanis had prepared strong delaying positions, protected by
minefields, at Nainakot, Tanda-Lallu Chak and Malakpur. In the territory East of the Bein river,
the Pakistani plan was to apply delaying tactics to retard the advance of Indian troops for as
long as possible, and in the process inflict maximum attrition. To this end, the border
observation posts were to pour down heavy automatic and artillery fire before withdrawing.

to capture Point 5000 first and then, using it as a firm base, develop operations up to Padma Go.
These operations were planned simultaneously with the assault 1/11 GR on the Khalubar Ridgeline
so that the enemy's attention would be divided. On the night of 30 June-01 July 1999, as part of
the brigade attack, one column launched an assault on Point 5000. Despite having to negotiate
steep escarpments and waist high snow at places, this column succeeded in capturing the objective.
However, further progress was slow due to the nature of the terrain. The objectives were softened
over the next few days with concentrated artillery and infantry mortar fire. In renewed attacks on

earned them three battle honours. After the War, in 1972, the Militia was converted into a full-
fledged Regiment and in 1976 the name was changed to Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry. The
JAK LI was deployed in the Indian Peacekeeping Force in Sri Lanka in 1987 and also in the United
Nations Mission in Somalia. During the Kargil War, the 12 Jammu Kashmir Light Infantry was
tasked to capture Point 4812 in the Batalik Sector, for which the unit received “unit","” from
General VP Malik, the then Chief of the Army Staff. Naib Subedar (later Subedar Major &
Honorary Captain) Bana Singh who was awarded the PVC for gallantry in Siachen in 1987 belongs
to the JAK LI.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and
Kashmir by any means. The Kargil war of 1999 was fought 52 years after independence. The war
commenced shortly after the signing of the Lahore declaration in 1999, when the Pakistan army
surreptitiously occupied the winter vacated posts of the Indian Army. This act is thought to be the
brain-child of General Pervez Musharraf, then Chief of the Pakistan Army. On 03 May 1999,
intrusions were detected. On 26 May 1, the first air to ground strike was launched by the Indian
Airforce (IAF), followed by Operation Vijay, by the Indian Army to evict the intruders from the
Indian territory2. After two months of violent confrontation, the war came to an end on 26 July
1999.
The challenges in the Batalik Sub-Sector were manifold as the enemy had intruded almost 8-10

inducted into the Batalik Sub-Sector on 09 May 1999. The 12 JAK LI was given the task of driving
a wedge between the enemy’s defences at Point 5203 (Eastern extremity) and Point 4812-Point
5287-Point 5000 (the Khalubar Ridgeline). Colonel VS Bhalotia, the Commanding Officer of 12
JAK LI planned to execute a multi-directional attack on Point 4812. He planned to execute an
assault with two columns of Charlie Company under Major DK Pathak and Lieutenant KC
Nongrum where tasked to assault from North and East side respectively. A column of Bravo
Company led by Captain Sanjeev Dhiman was to assault from the South and one column each
from Delta Company and Alpha Company under Major TS Bhandari and Major Rupinder Singh
were nominated as reserves. On 30 June 1999, at 2030 Hours the assault troop set out and the
attacking columns reached their respective positions by 0300 Hours on 01 July 1999.

fire from a well-sited UMG in a sangar. Two riflemen made the supreme sacrifice while trying to
close in with the sangar to silence this. Then, realising how important it was to clear the stubborn
sangar for the attack to succeed, Lieutenant Nongrum did the near impossible task of climbing up
a near-vertical cliff at Point 4812. He charged forward shouting ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"" the inspiring
war cry of the JAK LI Regiment and single-handedly overpowered the stubborn enemy. Though
he was seriously wounded, he continued to lead his men till the position was overrun. With victory
at his feet, Captain K C Nongrum made the supreme sacrifice on the field of battle and died a
hero's death. He was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra posthumously.

Knob on the Northern part of the objective. Realising that the fire of this automatic would not
permit his Team to capture the objective, Naik Yadav led his Squad to assault the enemy sangar
from where the fire was coming. On closing in with the sangar, he charged it fearlessly, lobbing
grenades and firing from the hip. Naik Yadav killed five enemy soldiers in a close quarter battle.
In the deadly exchange of fire, he was himself grievously wounded but continued to lead the
assault. Inspired by the fearlessness of this young commando, his comrades redoubled their efforts

Naik Kaushal Yadav was the squad commander of No 2 squad of 84 Troop 'BRAVO' team, 9
PARA (Special Forces) which was tasked to capture Zulu Top on 25 July 1999 during 'Operation
Vijay'.
The objective area was at a height of 5100 meters with no approaches from own side. The sheer
vertical slopes made the cliff assault extremely difficult, which was further compounded by minus
15-degree temperature and extensive enemy minefields.
Under such adverse conditions, Naik Kaushal Yadav's squad was tasked to gain a foothold on top
of Zulu Top from the Western approach. Using his extraordinary mountaineering skills he led his
squad and opened a route for his comrades to follow.
Naik Yadav's squad was on Zulu Top Complex by 0500hrs when from a rocky knob North of Zulu
Top Complex his squad came under heavy automatic fire. Realising that the enemy was trying to
evict him from his foothold, he personally led his squad from the front in assaulting the well-
entrenched enemy. On reaching the enemy fire position he leapt forward towards the enemy with
total disregard to his own safety lobbying grenades into their sangars and firing from the hip. The
enemy was shocked by the ferocious charge and in a deadly exchange of fire at close quarters,
Naik Kaushal Yadav personally killed five enemy soldiers. In the process he too was grievously
wounded and made the supreme sacrifice, but his action ensured the capture of Zulu Top.
During the entire action Naik Kaushal Yadav displayed courage, bravery and valour of the highest

Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (JAK LI) is an Infantry Regiment under the Indian Army.
The Regimental history of JAK LI is very unique. In 1947, when Pakistani troops intruded
into the Indian territory, militia groups were raised from the locals of Jammu, Nubra and Leh
under the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs. The militia fought with great distinction in the
1965 Indo-Pak War. However, it was the gallant actions of the militia troop in the Indo-Pak
War of 1971, that earned them three battle honours. After the war in 1972, the militia was
converted into a full-fledged Regiment and in 1976 the name was changed to Jammu and

Mazri in present day Jhajjar district of Haryana. He completed his primary education from
High School in Badli Block. After finishing his primary education, Lance Havildar Dharam
Singh enrolled in Indian Army in May 1953. He was posted to 5 JAT. During the Sino-India
of 1962, Lance Havildar Dharam Singh and his battalion were stationed in Ladakh's Daulat
Beg Oldi Sector.
The JAT Regiment is one of the oldest regiments of the Indian Army. It is an infantry
regiment that claims its origins to the Calcutta Native Militia raised in 1795, which later
became an infantry battalion of the Bengal Army. Jats were historically considered to be a
martial class and were enlisted in the British Army as per the policy on class regiments. In
1922, the grouping of the class regiment the 9 JAT was formed by bringing under a single
regiment, four active and one training battalion. In the post-independent era, the Jat regiment
has lived up to their reputation and holds the distinction of fighting in all the wars that India
fought since its independence including with the IPKF in Sri Lanka. Their battle cry: Jat
Balwan, Jai Bhagwan was adopted in 1955. During the 1962 Sino-India War, 5 JAT fought
the Chinese with indomitable spirit and bravery and were awarded theatre Honour “Ladakh
1962”.
Since independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after
its establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant
diplomatic status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of
state recognition of PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter
into negotiations with China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel
Agreement in 1954. Within a few weeks of Chou Enlai’s visit to India in 1954, the Chinese
launched a protest against the presence of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometers south of
a border pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the first time, the Government of China
laid claim to any part of Indian territory formally. The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang
Road in 1957 marked a turning point in the Sino-India relations as the Chinese occupied a
large part of the Aksai Chin. This opened an opportunity for China to come out with
territorial claims against India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved in further into
Ladakh and established themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal, just south of
Dambu Guru. On 08 September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Post in
the Eastern sector and began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in the Eastern
sector in Namka Chu sector as well as in the Western sector in Ladakh. The overwhelming
number of the Chinese troops attacked the Indian soldiers but the Indian soldiers fought theenemy with grit and determination. The Chinese announced the cease-fire at midnight of
21/22 November 1962.1

was not just with the enemy but also with the high-altitude terrain. In September 1962,

against Posts 2 and 3 manned by 5 JAT located on the Northern bank of Chip Chap River.
The personnel of these two posts were then asked to fall back to Post 4 by first light on 20
October 1962. The Chinese had already started occupying the other posts but the Indian
soldiers continued to hold onto Post 4 despite heavy enemy shelling. Around 1900 Hr on 20
October, the Chinese recommenced the shelling of Post 4. Seeing the gravity of the situation,
officiating commander of the DBO garrison, Major Randhawa, ordered the men of 5 JAT
located there to withdraw to DBO2.
Lance Havildar Dharam. Singh was Commander of a post in Ladakh. On 22 October 1962,
many Chinese attackers stormed this position. Heavy mortars were used by Chinese army to
support the attack. To deceive the enemy forming up in a superior number, Lance Havildar
Dharam Singh employed a novel method. He left two men with a Light Machine Gun (LMG)
to fire intermittently at the enemy. He positioned others on a flank and returned the fire. He
maintained this position for two days against overwhelming odds. Despite being injured in
leg by enemy mortar splinter, he moved from one position to the other. He kept inspiring his
men to hold the post and not give up. This valiant action of Lance Havildar Dharam Singh
strengthened our defences further north.
Lance Havildar Dharam. Singh displayed conspicuous courage and exemplary leadership
skills in the face of enemy; and was awarded Vir Chakra for his bravery.

During the Sino India War of 1962, Sepoy Sonam Rabges fought the Chinese in Ladakh Sector
bravely and sacrificed himself for the nation.
The LADAKH SCOUTS known as the “Snow Warriors” were initially raised as a Paramilitary
Force formed of the Ladakhi locals known as Nubra Guards to save Ladakh from intruders in
1948. It comprised of Ladakhi locals who are physically fit and attuned with the rugged terrain
and hostile climate. In 1952, the Nubra Guards were merged as the 7th Battalion of the Jammu
& Kashmir Militia, which later became the Jammu & Kashmir Light Infantry (JAK LI)
Regiment. The Ladakh Scouts was raised in 1963, following the Indo China War of 1962. It
was formed by spinning off the 7th and 14th Battalions of J&K MILITIA. LADAKH SCOUTS
had two Wings- the Karakoram Wing, defending the Eastern front facing China and the Indus
Wing facing Pakistan. They fought in the 1965 and 1971 India Pakistan War and were also part
of Operation Meghdoot in 1984. The also played a significant role by marking one of the

The fighting in Ladakh during the 1962 War was in three distinct phases. The first Phase began
on 19 October night when Chinese commenced their attacks against the isolated 'Forward
Policy’ Posts. This Phase lasted till 27 October. Between this time and 18 November there was

Chinese build up was mainly opposite Spangur Gap, the Indian side strengthened defences in
depth. In the third and final phase the Chinese overwhelmed the Indian defences on the Eastern
edge of Chushul airfield. On declaration of Cease-Fire on 21 November 1962, the Chinese had
rendered the airfield unusable for use.
In this Sector, the peculiar geography of Ladakh made it doubly difficult for the soldiers as the
struggle was not just with the enemy but also with the high-altitude terrain. In September 1962,
Ladakh was defended by 114 Brigade consisting of 5 JAT, 1/8 GORKHA RIFLES, 7 and 14
JAMMU & KASHMIR MILITIA located at Leh. 14 J&K MILITIA with a company of 5 JAT
was in Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) sector. The remaining elements of 5 JAT were in
Changchenmo Sector, 1/8 GORKHA RIFLES was in Chushul with 7 J&K MILITIA at the
Indus Valley Sector. The Indus Valley Sector lies south of Chushul. Dungti was an important
location from where a road went North to Chusul, west to Leh and South along the Indus to
Demchok. The Indus River valley South of Dungati is a flat open area flanked by low hills on
the East. The international boundary followed the Eastern hills. These hills had several passes
opening to Tibetan plateau. Vehicular movement along presented no problems and excellent
airfield existed at Fukche. The road communications on the Chinese side were not well
developed and the only approach was from the South. The Chinese were estimated to have had
a battalion located in Tashigong.
On the Indian side 7 J&K MILITIA was responsible for the defence of this Sub-Sector with its
Headquarters at Koyul with one Company, Company worth at Dungti and the rest of the troops
being deployed along the passes and bottlenecks along the international border. The Chinese
attacks in this sector started on 27 October. They attacked simultaneously at Changla, Jarala,
New Demchok and High Ground (North West of Demchok). The Chinese plan of attack
followed the pattern established elsewhere. They launched simultaneous attacks on Changla
and Jarala Posts that held the line of low hills on Eastern side of Indus valley. Once having
tackled these posts they then infiltrated between Fukche and the extreme Southern posts of
New Demchok and High Ground, thus making these untenable. Once having occupied the
Kailash range that dominated the Eastern bank of the Indus valley, they in effect denied its use
by the Indians.
Changla Post was well dug-in with wire obstacles around it. It was defended by seventeen men
of 7 J&K MILITIA. In the early hours of 27 October, the Chinese approached the vicinity of
the post in thirty odd vehicles. The vehicles were mounted with machine guns, which opened
fire on the Indian Post. The response from Indians was quick in coming using 2-inch mortar
and two Chinese leading vehicles were set on fire. The men held their fire till the Chinese came
close and within their rifle range. The two light machine guns (LMG) effectively engaged
attacking Chinese. After nearly three hours of fire fight, the vastly outnumbered Post
Commander decided to withdraw his men. Nearly 300 Chinese soldiers had surrounded thepost. The Post Commander divided his party in two. and while one party moved, he himself
gave covering fire with LMG. The threat to Dungti and Koyul also needed to be averted and
therefore the troops in conjunction with those at High Ground were asked to carry out a
withdrawal by night 27/28 October. The withdrawal was successfully completed by 2330
hours. The defenders successfully evaded the Chinese roadblock under the cover of darkness
and arrived in Koyul in good spirit. The newly established 3 Himalayan Division as well as 15
Corps gave a serious thought to order withdrawal from Koyul as well, but in the end left the
decision to the Commander on the spot, Lieutenant Colonel RM Banon. He preferred to stay
put and strengthen the defences rather than withdraw. The Indians continued to occupy these
positions. There was some confusion regarding outposts at Hanle and Zarser and Chumar lying
to the South West of this Sector. These posts were held by CRP/ITBP and went out of
communication on 27 October. These were also presumed to have fallen to the Chinese. But
by 31 October it; transpired that all these posts were intact. At the end of the fighting on 28
October, the Chinese had established control of the Eastern hills flanking the Indus valley.
Sepoy Sonam Rabges was at a posted in Ladakh during the attack. His post was also heavily
shelled and attacked by the Chinese on 27 October 1962. Sepoy Sonam Rabges fought bravely
and remained at his post until he was killed in his trench fighting the enemy.

participated effectively in the 1857 First War of Independence. This war proved to be beneficial
for the Sikhs as it revealed their valour and fighting tenacity. Under the British Indian Army,
the Sikh Regiment fought gallantly in a number of war and battles including the Battle of
Saragarhi in which they left an indelible mark in the regiment’s history. By 1914 the Sikh
Regiment was deployed as part of British Indian Army for operations in World War I. The
Regiment served in all theatres of operations and earned 28 battle honours. The modern Sikh
Regiment traces its roots directly from the 11th Sikh Regiment of the British Indian Army.
When transferred to the Indian Army post-Independence, the numeral 11 was removed and
new battalions were added.10 This was the battalion that was the first battalion to be airlifted
to Kashmir Valley in October 1947 and their CO, Lieutenant Colonel DR Rai laid down his
life at Baramulla and was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra. 1 SIKH was later mechanised in 1970
and re-designated as 4 MECHANISED INFANTRY on 02 April 1979 also known as the
Bravest of the Brave. Jemadar Nand Singh of the Battalion was awarded the Victoria Cross in
World War II and thereafter the Mahavir Chakra in 1947-48. Subedar Joginder Singh was
awarded the Para Vir Chakra in 1962.
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after
its establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant
diplomatic status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state
recognition of PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into
negotiations with China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement
in 1954. Within a few weeks of Chou Enlai’s visit to India in 1954, the Chinese launched a
protest against the presence of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometers south of a border
pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the first time, the Government of China laid claim
to any part of Indian territory formally. The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957,
marked a turning point in the Sino-India relations as the Chinese occupied a large part of the
Aksai Chin. This opened an opportunity for China to come out with territorial claims against
India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved in further into Ladakh and established
themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal, just south of Dambu Guru. On 08
September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Post in the Eastern sector and
began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in the Eastern sector in Namka Chu
sector as well as in the Western sector in Ladakh. The overwhelming number of the Chinese
troops attacked the Indian soldiers but they fought the enemy with grit and determination. The
Chinese announced the cease-fire at midnight of 21/22 November 1962.11

Government of India.On 09 September 1962, India's then-Defence Minister Krishna Menon decided to evict the
Chinese troops stationed South of Thagla Ridge due to the increasing intensity of Chinese
incursions into Indian Territory. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's then Prime Minister,
who was in London for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, agreed with this
decision. 7 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier JP Dalvi was then given the order to
advance to Namka Chu, which was considered as an advantageous ground for the Chinese.
Being aware of this advantage, Chinese attacked the Indian post at Namka Chu on 20 October
1962 with overwhelming strength. The Indian Army fought the assault but were soon
overpowered by enemy’s strength in number and superior weapons. Soon after this attack, the
Chinese army advanced towards Tawang. A Divisional sized force advanced across Bum La
which was held only by a company of 1 SIKH. Hopelessly outnumbered yet ready to face
Chinese forces, this Company which included Subedar Joginder Singh faced the wave upon
wave of Chinese soldiers. 12

Delhi, India.23 October. On 23 October 1962, around 0530 hours, the Chinese launched a fierce offensive
on the Bum La axis with the aim of reaching Tawang. The enemy's leading Battalion launched
three waves, each about 200 strong. Lieutenant Hari Pal Kaushik was commanding a Company
holding the Tongpeng La position in NEFA. At 0530 hours on 23 October 1962, the Chinese
started attacking with a Regiment on the Bum La axis with the intention of breaking through
to Tawang. His Company’s position was first attacked by a Chinese Battalion, but the attack
was repulsed, with heavy losses, by his forward platoon. It was in this action, when Subedar
Joginder Singh displayed conspicuous gallantry was awarded Param Vir Chakra posthumously.
After the fall of the forward Platoon, a second Battalion of the enemy attacked on a wide front
trying to overrun the Company position. Lieutenant Hari Pal Kaushik moved from one Section
position to another under enemy fire encouraging his troops. He was a source of inspiration to
his men who continued to fight with great determination under his leadership. Eventually, when
under heavy enemy pressure, he was ordered to make a tactical withdrawal to another mountain
pass, a tough task considering there was an enemy with superior firepower on the prowl.
Despite this, he handled the withdrawal skilfully and managed to clear, in face or enemy fire,
all his personnel and weapons including heavy mortars and medium machine guns. Later, he
was part of a Column that the Chinese ambushed. But he and fourteen other soldiers managed
to dodge the bullets. When they reached the new Battalion base in Assam, they had been
reduced to skeletons.

were better equipped and well-trained to fight in inhospitable terrain. The attack in this sector
started on 18 November, coinciding with the attack on Sela in NEFA. The Chinese launched a
two-pronged attack on Chushul’s defenses. The Northern prong attacked Gurung Hill and the
second prong of the Chinese troops attacked Charlie Company of 13 KUMAON which was the
Ahir company at Rezang La, an isolated feature, about 11 km South of Spangur Gap. Rezang La

took shelter behind boulders. At about 0540 Hr the Chinese opened artillery and mortar fire at the
Indian troops. The telephone lines to the battalion HQ got cut and the radio set was destroyed. The
fight at Rezang La was hard and bitter3. Notwithstanding the disadvantages of climate, terrain and

their defensive position at Rezang La would make the enemy pay a heavy price.
Jemadar Surja played a major role during this defensive battle at Rezang La in Chushul sub-sector.
The Chinese forces attacked the Rezang La company post in Ladakh after a heavy concentration
of artillery and mortar fire. Charlie Company under Major Shaitan Singh had replaced 1/8
GORKHA RIFLES at Rezang La in the Chushul sub-sector in Ladakh on 06 November 1962. He
deployed his company on the forward slopes of the hill. No.7 Platoon under Jemadar Surja was on
the North flank. No.8 Platoon under Jemadar Hari Ram was in the pass area and No.9 Platoon
under Jemadar Ram Chander held the centre of the position. Despite being vastly outnumbered,
the defending company fought valiantly and inflicted considerable fatalities on the enemy. Despite
the heavy casualties, Jemadar Surja and his men continued to hold firmly to their defenses. After
suffering heavy casualties, the Chinese brought forward reinforcements and a medium machine
gun. When the fire of the gun came upon No.7 Platoon Jemadar Surja and his team fought bravely
and resolutely unmindful of own safety until the entire platoon died fighting the enemy.

Artillery and was later renamed 5 Bombay Mountain Battery. In May 1857, the mutiny by Indian
soldiers started in the Artillery of the Army of the Bengal Presidency. The incident prompted a
complete ban on Indian Artillery units, except the Mountain Artillery Batteries in select Provinces.
The decision was reversed in the mid-1930s when the first of the Field Regiments of the Indian
Army were raised. The Field Regiments support the formations on the field. The Regimental motto
of Artillery Regiment ‘Sarvatra Izzat-O-Iqbal’ which means ‘Everywhere with Honour and
Glory’.1 Amongst the Army Chiefs from the Regiment of Artillery are General PP

Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China since both the countries
shared political, geographical and cultural similarities. Therefore, soon after its establishment on
01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant diplomatic status to the People’s
Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state recognition of PRC on various
international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into negotiations with China on the
question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement in 1954. Within a few weeks of Chou
Enlai’s visit to India, the Chinese launched a protest against the presence of Indian troops in
Barahoti, three kilometers South of a border pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the first
time, the Government of China laid claim to any part of Indian territory formally. The construction
of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957, marked a turning point in the Sino-India relations as the
Chinese occupied a large part of the Aksai Plateau. This opened an opportunity for China to come
out with territorial claims against India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved in further into
Ladakh and established themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal, just South of Dambu
Guru. On 08 September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Post in the Eastern
sector and began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in NEFA in Namku Chu

During the Sino-India War of 1962, Gunner Gurdip Singh was deployed in Ladakh and he fought
valiantly in the battle of Gurung Hill. The war in the West was fought in Ladakh. Ladakh, a part
of frontier province of Jammu and Kashmir is also part of the Greater Himalayan Range. The
mountains of Ladakh, perhaps the most rugged and inhospitable in the world.

night when Chinese commenced their attacks against the Isolated 'Forward Policy’ Posts. This
Phase lasted till 27 October between this time and 18 November there was lull in fighting . This
period was utilized by both sides to build up their strengths, while Chinese build up was mainly
opposite Spangur Gap, the Indian side strengthened defences in the depth. In third and final Phase
the Chinese overwhelmed the Indian defences on the Eastern edge of Chushul airfield. The cease
fire was declared on of 21 November 1962, by when the Chinese had rendered the airfield unusable
for Indians.

After being relieved by 5 JAT in second week of October 1962, a Company less Platoon strength
was deployed in Sirijap Compex North of Pangong lake. This Post was supplied by boats across
the lake and had no land link with the Battalion. South of Pangong Lake was the Yula Complex
consisting of three Posts manned by another Company 1/8 GORKHA RIFLES. Nearly two
Companies defended the Spangur Gap. Both the hills on the Northern Shoulder named Gurung
Hill and to the South Magar Hill, were held. In addition, there was a Post in the Gap itself.

On 18 November the Chinese attack in this Sector started, coinciding with their attack on Sela in
NEFA. The Chinese were obviously working to a timetable. Chushul with its airfield and the
Indian brigade was a thorn in the Chinese flesh as that provided a possible jump off point for an
Indian threat to the Chinese occupied Aksai Chin and the highway running through it. In fact a
cursory thought was given by the CGS to the possibility of offensive across Spangur Gap in order
to relieve pressure in the Chip Chap valley. The idea did not progress any further, as the Indians
did not have adequate strength for it.
The Chinese launched a two-pronged attack on Chushul defences. northern prong of attack and
nearly regiment strength, attacked Gurung hill. Basically, the Chinese, lower half of Black Top
Hill was under Chinese. The Chinese thus had the advantage of attacking down-hill, which alwaysis a major consideration in mountains. The attack on Gurung Hill posed a direct threat to Chushul
airfield.
The going for the invading Chinese was tougher at Gurung Hill. The Chinese attacked Gurung Hill
complex simultaneously with their attacked Rezangla. the approach chosen was from Black Hill,
that gave them an advantage of attacking from the ground. At 0530 Hours on 18 November, the
Chinese began intense bombardment of Gurung Hill as well as the Indian posts located in the
Spangur Gap and Mugga Hill.
Two companies of 1/8 Gorkha Rifles were defending the vast area of Gurung Hill. The troops had
well dug positions protected by wire and some Anti- personnel mines. and the attack was expected
from the direction of Black Hill; the defenses were therefore ready to face the Chinese. The first
wave of attackers made contact with the northern company of the Gurung hill at 0630 Hours. Here
the Chinese were in a surprise. When still outside the small arms range, they engaged the Chinese
troops by accurate fire from the guns of 13 FIELD REGIMENT. Second Lieutenant S.D.Goswami,
the Artillery Observation Officer, did a commendable of directing the fire. When Second
Lieutenant S.D Goswami was wounded, Technical Assistant Gurdip Singh, though severely
wounded himself, took over command of the Post and continued to directed the fire of our Artillery
on the enemy thereby inflicting heavy casualties on them. In this action Technical Assistant Gurdip
Singh displayed great initiative and courage of a high order and was awarded Vir Chakra
Posthumously.
The brave Gorkhas were finally overwhelmed by vastly superior numbers, and the forward
Platoon fell. Out of 17 men in this Platoon the every single one died fighting the Chinese. The
Chinese launched a series of attacks and finally, after two hours, a detachment managed to occupy
some portions of Gurung Hill, the energetic Platoon Commander there, Tej Bahadur Gurung got
his men out from the trenches, and using, traditional Gorkha Khukri (a small curved knife) on the
Chinese. The Chinese had to fall back fearing this fierce onslaught. By 1000 hours the situation
stabilized and Gurung Hill remained firmly in Indian hands. In the meanwhile, Chinese were
continuously shelling the Spangur Gap as well as airfield. The track between Gurung Hill and the
Battalion Headquarters was no longer usable. The men on Gun Hill were asked to conserve their
ammunition for second attack by the Chinese, which was expected soon. The second attack was
preceded by even intense shelling.","(1155599) GUNNER (TECHNICAL ASSISTANT) GURDIP SINGH

was part of the historic Battle in Rezang La where against overwhelming hordes of Chinese he
fought the enemy with great courage and gallantry.
The KUMAON Regiment traces its origins to the 18th century and has fought in every major
campaign of the British Indian Army and the Indian Army including the two world wars. During
World War I, a Kumaon battalion was raised at Ranikhet on 23 October 1917 as 34/39th Kumaon
Rifles. In 1918, it was redesignated as 1st battalion, 50th Kumaon Rifles and a second battalion was
raised. These were merged with Hyderabad contingent into the 19th Hyderabad Regiment in 1923.
On 27 October 1945, the 19th Hyderabad was renamed as 19 Kumaon Regiment. Post-
Independence, it has been known as the Kumaon Regiment. Staying true to the regimental motto
of Parakramo Vijayate (Valour Triumphs) the regiment has proved its mettle in Indo-Pak War of
1947-48, Sino-India War of 1962, Indo-Pak War 1971, Kargil War of 1999 and also participated
in the Indian Peace-keeping Force in Sri Lanka. During the Sino-India War of 1962, 13 KUMAON
displayed conspicuous courage and undaunted determination while fighting the enemy during the
Battle of Rezang La, where Major Shaitan Singh received the Param Vir Chakra. 1 Two Chiefs of

The Chinese launched a two-pronged attack on Chushul defences. The Northern prong attacked
Gurung Hill and the second prong of the Chinese troops attacked Charlie Company of 13

Spangur Gap. Rezang La dominated the life line of the Chushul garrison- the road link with Leh
that went via Dungti. The Company was commanded by Major Shaitan Singh.

The Chinese approached the Indian position through the nallahs that came up to the hill top. At
around 0500 hours on 18 November 1962, C Company 13 KUMAON defending Rezang La
opened up with every weapon they had. After nearly half an hour of intense firing in the first round,
the Chinese took shelter behind boulders. At about 0540 hours the Chinese opened artillery and
mortar fire at the Indian troops. The telephone lines to the Battalion HQ got cut and the radio set
was destroyed. The fight at Rezang La was hard and bitter. Notwithstanding the disadvantages of
climate, terrain and weapons, Major Shaitan Singh and the C Company of 13 KUMAON went all
out to make sure their defensive position at Rezang La would make the enemy pay a heavy price.Charlie Company under Major Shaitan Singh had replaced 1/8 GORKHA RIFLES at Rezang La
on 06 November 1962. He deployed his Company on the forward slopes of the hill. No 7 Platoon
under Jemadar Surja was on the North flank. No 8 Platoon under Jamadar Hari Ram was in the
pass area and No 9 Platoon under Jemadar Ram Chander held the centre of the defended locality.
Naik Hukam Chand was Second in Command of No 8 Platoon. He noticed a large body of men
heading towards his platoon defended locality. He immediately informed his Platoon Commander
and fired a red Varey light which showed a huge Chinese column advancing. In the illuminated
area, Platoon No 7 & 9 also noticed a wave of Chinese moving towards their defences. All three
Platoons mutually supported each other during the attack. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the
Company fought valiantly and inflicted considerable fatalities on the Chinese army. However,
even after suffering heavy casualties, the Chinese assault didn’t stop. They brought forward
reinforcements and a medium machine gun. Naik Hukam Chand, when ran out of ammunition,
engaged the Chinese in a fierce hand-to-hand close combat before being overpowered.
Despite the odds, our forces repelled several waves of hostile onslaught. Major Shaitan Singh, the
Company commander was seriously wounded. Seeing that it was no longer possible to hold the
position with a handful of men, he ordered the men to withdraw from the post. Naik Hukam Chand
and a sepoy were carrying the wounded Company Commander, when they came under heavy
machine gun fire. Major Shaitan Singh ordered the men to leave him where he was in order to save
their lives but Naik Hukam Chand gallantly remained with him and did not return.

1940 in Rawalpindi, now in Pakistan. After moving to Delhi with his family after partition, Second
Lieutenant Kohli completed his schooling from Ramjas Higher Secondary School, New Delhi. He
was enrolled in 9 PUNJAB of the Indian Army on 17 December 1961 at the age of 21 after passing
out from the Indian Military Academy at Dehra Dun. During the Sino- India War of 1962, Second
Lieutenant Naveen Chander Kohli was part of the historic Battle in NEFA where he fought the
enemy with great courage, valour and displayed exemplary leadership.
The PUNJAB Regiment, among the oldest in the Indian Army, traces its origins back to 1805 when
the First Battalion was raised under the Maharaja of Patiala. Originally, the Regiment comprised
four British-raised Battalions. The numbers and titles of the Battalions changed during the
successive reorganisations of the Madras Presidency Army, the British Indian Army and the Indian
Army during 18th, 19th and 20th Century. After the 1857, the British applied the martial races theory
and North Indian troops replaced the South Indians. Post Independence, the PUNJAB Regiment
of India was formed from the 2nd Punjab Regiment of the British Indian Army. In 1951, four battle
experienced Battalions of the former Princely states of Punjab, joined the Regiment. These
battalions were from the Jind and Nabha State Forces and the first and second Battalions of Patiala
Infantry. They were designated as the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th battalions of the PUNJAB
Regiment. Additional Battalions have been raised since 1963. Since 1947, the PUNJAB Regiment
has taken part in various battle sand wars, winning numerous honours and awards for the same.
The Regimental Centre of the Regiment was first raised at Loralai and was shifted to Multan in
1922, Meerut in 1929 and at last to its present location in Ramgarh, Jharkhand in 1976.1 During
the Sino-India war of 1962, the Regiment was deployed in the North-East Frontier Agency Sector
(NEFA) as part of 7 Infantry Brigade of 4 Infantry Division and fought valiantly in the crucial
battles in Namka Chu Sector.
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after its

On 09 September 1962, India's then-Defense Minister Krishna Menon decided to evict the Chinese
troops stationed South of Thagla Ridge due to the increasing intensity of Chinese incursions into
Indian Territory. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's then Prime Minister, who was in London
for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, agreed with this decision. The 7 Infantry

Government of India.Brigade commanded by Brigadier JP Dalvi was then given the order to advance to Namka Chu,
which was considered as an advantageous ground for the Chinese. Being aware of this advantage,
Chinese attacked the Indian Post at Namka Chu on 20 October 1962 with overwhelming strength.
The Indian Army fought the assault but were soon overpowered by enemy’s strength in number
and superior weapons.
On the. eve of their attack on 19-20 October night, the Chinese had about four Battalions South of
the Thag La Ridge and two Companies in the vicinity of Khinzemane. They had also moved a
Battalion to Shao and nearly another Battalion to the subsidiary passes between Thag La and
Karpola II. The Chinese were also holding the rear positions between Thag La and Marmang in
depth. By 20 October, the Chinese had built up their strength to an estimated one Division in the
Thag La and Khinzemane areas. It was also reported that they had positioned an additional
Division in Bum La area. They had access to three routes (tracks) to reach Tawang. The rapid and
heavy build-up of the Chinese troops, armed with heavy mortars and Machine Guns and equipped
with modern entrenching tools, had forced the Indian Government to postpone the operation to
evict the Chinese from their illegal encroachment, North of the Namka Chu. It was felt that the
task would, for the time being, have to be limited to holding the Namka Chu. 7 Infantry Brigade,
commanded by Brigadier JP Dalvi, with its Headquarters at Rongla was provided with four
Infantry Battalions, less two Companies. They were 9 PUNJAB, 4 GRENADIERS, 2 RAJPUTS
AND 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES along with some Artillery.
The Chinese, who had been subjecting the Indian Post at Tsang Le on the North bank of Namka
Chu, to heavy shelling since 17 October, but left this Post alone when at 0500 hrs on 20 October,
they engaged other Posts all along the Namkha Chu by heavy mortar fire. In the very first few
shellings, telephone lines, linking the Brigade Headquarters with the units, went dead, leaving the
Units/Companies on their own and take any action they considered the best. Brigade Headquarters
was informed by the Dhola Post had been completely over run by the Chinese. At approximately
0715 hours Captain Ravi Eipe of 2 RAJPUT came to Brigade Headquarters to report that his
Company had been wiped cut. He informed that the Chinese attacked his position from rear
through the Dhola area. Around the same time, 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES extreme left Company was
fighting a pitched battle with Chinese. But this too was overrun by Chinese at approximately 0745
hours and the Company Commander with two other officers was killed.
By the time the RAJPUT, the GORKHA and the GRENADIERS collapsed, the Eastern, Western
and the Tsangdhar columns of Chinese troops had swung around. Now, the Chinese troops
engaged with three Companies of 9 PUNJAB. Chinese fire was returned by Punjabis. Following
the withdrawal orders from the GOC 4 Infantry Division Major General Nirinjan Prasad, 9
PUNJAB took up a position at Hathongla. Withdrawal was to take place along the track. TheBattalion started withdrawal around 1200 hours and completed it by 1430 hours. The Chinese had
started shelling Bridge 2 Positions by then and also formed up on the North bank of the river for
assault.
During this action, Second Lieutenant Kohli was tasked to stay behind as Officer Commanding
the Rear Parties to cover the withdrawal. He personally went round the entire defences and sited
all the automatic weapons. The Chinese seeing the withdrawal of the unit, intensified their shelling
and assaulted the position. But the defenders, under the able leadership of Second Lieutenant
Kohli, with a heavy volume of small arms fire from all directions, foiled the first wave of the
Chinese assault inflicting heavy casualties on them. During this attack Lieutenant Kohli went from
bunker to bunker encouraging his men, inspiring confidence and giving first aid to the wounded.
At one bunker where a gunner had been wounded seriously, he himself manned the gun. It was
only after the Battalion had reasonable time to pull out and the enemy pressure against the position
had increased tremendously by a second wave of assaulting troops, that he ordered the rear parties
to abandon the positions. He was one of the last to leave the post; and exercised his command so
skilfully that he managed to take out his entire force, including the wounded, and join the main
body of the Battalion.
The courage and dedication displayed by Second Lieutenant Naveen Chander Kohli in the face of
the enemy was a source of inspiration to his men. Throughout the action, he displayed
commendable courage and exemplary devotion to duty. He was awarded Vir Chakra for his
gallantry.","Second Lieutenant Naveen Chander Kohli (IC-12955) The Punjab Regiment.

sector as well as in the Western sector in Ladakh. The overwhelming number of the Chinesetroops attacked the Indian soldiers but they fought the enemy with grit and determination. The
Chinese announced the cease-fire at midnight of 21/22 November 1962.1 During the war,
NEFA was a hub of enemy invasions.

On 09 September 1962, India's then - Defence Minister Krishna Menon decided to evict the
Chinese troops stationed South of Thagla Ridge due to the increasing intensity of Chinese
incursions into Indian Territory. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's then Prime Minister,
who was in London for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, agreed with this
decision. 7 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier JP Dalvi was then given the order to
advance to Namka Chu, which was considered as an advantageous ground for the Chinese.
Being aware of this advantage, Chinese attacked the Indian Post at Namka Chu on 20 October
1962 with overwhelming strength. The Indian Army fought the assault but were soon
overpowered by enemy’s strength in number and superior weapons.
On the eve of their attack on 19-20 October night, the Chinese had about four Battalions South
of the Thag La Ridge and two Companies in the vicinity of Khinzemane. They had also moved

Government of India.a Battalion to Shao and nearly another Battalion to the subsidiary passes between Thag La and
Karpola II. The Chinese were also holding the rear positions between Thag La and Marmang
in depth. By 20 October, the Chinese had built up their strength to an estimated one Division
in the Thag La and Khinzemane areas. It was also reported that they had positioned an
additional Division in Bum La area. They had access to three routes (tracks) to reach Tawang.
The rapid and heavy build-up of the Chinese troops, armed with heavy mortars and Machine
Guns and equipped with modern entrenching tools, had forced the Indian Government to
postpone the operation to evict the Chinese from their illegal encroachment, North of the
Namka Chu. It was felt that the task would, for the time being, have to be limited to holding
the Namka Chu. 7 Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier JP Dalvi, with its Headquarters
at Rongla was provided with four Infantry Battalions, less two Companies. They were 9
PUNJAB, 4 GRENADIERS, 2 RAJPUTS AND 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES along with some
Artillery.
The Chinese, who had been subjecting the Indian Post at Tsang Le on the North Bank of Namka
Chu, to heavy shelling since 17 October, but left this Post alone when at 0500 hours on 20
October, they engaged other Posts all along the Namkha Chu by heavy mortar fire. In the very
first few artillery barrages, telephone lines, linking the Brigade Headquarters with the units,
went dead, leaving the Units/Companies on their own and take any action they considered the
best. Brigade Headquarters was informed by the Dhola Post had been completely over run by
the Chinese.
Walong in the Lohit Frontier Division was another area in Arunachal Pradesh witnessing major
and intense fighting. In march 1962, 6 KUMAON was ordered to relieve 2 RAJPUT and the
complete operational responsibility was taken over by 6 KUMOAN on 21 April. During the
War, in October 1962, Army Head Quarters asked the Eastern Command to consider
withdrawing bulk of the troops from Subansiri, Siang and Lohit Frontier Divisions. They were
also asked to consider using the entire 23 Infantry Division to contain he enemy thrust from
Walong. 2 Infantry Division was formed to take over operational responsibility in Subansiri,
Siang and Lohit Frontier Divisions of NEFA, its GOC, Major General M S Pathania, arrived
at Walong on 26 October to the forward areas. With two battalions located at Walong but
without a coordinating HQ located nearby, the new GOC found inherent problems of command
and control of troops in the Walong Sector. Accordingly, on 29 October 1962, it was decided
that operations in the Walong Sector would be looked after by an independent Infantry Brigade.
For this purpose, first 181 Infantry Brigade and finally 11 Infantry Brigade (then located in
Nagaland) was placed under 2 Infantry Division. The new Brigade Commander, Brigadier (
later Lieutenant General) N C Rawlley, MC, arrived in Walong on 31 October and the same
evening he called for a conference of his COs and told them: “There was going to be no
withdrawal from this place – everybody must get that straight”.Operations in Walong Sector during 1962 Sino India War

The presence of the enemy on the Green and Yellow Pimples in the Sector was cause of concern
as Green Pimple dominated Lachhman Ridge and Maha Plateau. The approach to Green Pimple
was through Tri-junction and Yellow Pimple. Moreover, advance of another 3 km along that
Spur by the enemy meant his domination of Walong Airstrip and Dropping Zone. Anticipating
the danger from the enemy, 'A' Company of 6 KUMAON under Captain Ravi Kumar Mathur
was sent on 05 November 1962 to clear the enemy from area Green Pimple and then to
reconnoitre the route from Green Pimple to Ashi Hill. He was personally briefed by Brigadier
Rawlley. The Company was to get fire support from heavy mortars of 71 Battery and on that
day the Battery fired 110 rounds on Green Pimple, Yellow Pimple and left edge of MahaPlateau. Brigadier Rawlley had ordered another wide recce patrol to set off from the Maha
Plateau under the command of Second Lieutenant Pradeep Singh Bhandari, who was occupying
an observation post of 71 Heavy Mortar Battery. His party, consisting of his own men
supplemented by Assam Rifles troops, camped for the night just below the crest of the West
Ridge. The next morning, they skirted past Green Pimple—so named because of the colour of
the vegetation that covered it—and spent the night on Yellow Pimple.2
On 03 November 1962, Second Lieutenant Pradeep Singh Bhandari was detailed to go out with
a patrol to a position in NEFA, outflanking the Chinese main defences and to act as the Forward
Observation Officer for a period of three days. The aim of the patrol was to bring down
observed artillery fire on enemy positions and to gain the maximum information regarding the
concentration and movement of the enemy. The patrol travelled over very difficult terrain,
operating at height of over 14, 000-ft. It spent two nights behind enemy positions and collected
very valuable information. On the return journey the patrol was ambushed on the 04 November
1962 by a numerically superior Chinese force. The patrol assaulted the enemy four times but
each time was driven back by heavy enemy fire. Realising the vital necessity of getting the
information of the presence of enemy forces on the flank, to the Brigade Headquarters, Second
Lieutenant Bhandari decided to fight his way through to the base. He kept the patrol on the
move throughout the night over difficult and rugged terrain and brought it back to the base
safely. During the night the enemy attempted to intercept Second Lieutenant Bhandari and his
party several times, but did not succeed due to his determination. After further night's march
the patrol finally reached the brigade headquarters on 05 November 1962.
Throughout the action, Second Lieutenant Pradeep Singh Bhandari displayed considerable
presence of mind, leadership and courage of a high order. He was awarded Vir Chakra for his
great devotion to duty.

The KUMAON Regiment traces its origins to the 18th Century and has fought in every major
campaign of the British Indian Army and the Indian Army including the two World Wars.
During World War I, a Kumaon Battalion was raised at Ranikhet on 23 October 1917 as
34/39th Kumaon Rifles. In 1918, it was redesigned as 1st Battalion, 50th Kumaon Rifles and a

Hyderabad Regiment in 1923. On 27 October 1945, the 19th Hyderabad was renamed as 19
Kumaon Regiment. Post Independence, it has been known as the Kumaon Regiment. Staying
true to the Regimental motto of Parakramo Vijayate (Valour Triumphs) the regiment has
proved its mettle in Indo-Pak War of 1947-48, Sino-India War of 1962, Indo-Pak War 1971,
Kargil War of 1999 and also participated in the Indian Peace-keeping Force in Sri Lanka.
During the Sino-India War of 1962, 13 KUMAON displayed conspicuous courage and
undaunted determination while fighting the enemy during the Battle of Rezang La, where
Major Shaitan Singh received the Param Vir Chakra.3 The KUMAON Regiment has
contributed three Chiefs to the Indian Army namely General SM Shringesh, General KS
Thimayya, DSO and General TN Raina, MVC.
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after
its establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant
diplomatic status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state
recognition of PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into
negotiations with China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement
in 1954. Within a few weeks of Chou Enlai’s visit to India in 1954, the Chinese launched a
protest against the presence of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometers South of a border
pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the first time, the Government of China laid claim
to any part of Indian territory formally. The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957
marked a turning point in the Sino-India relations as the Chinese occupied a large part of the
Aksai Chin. This opened an opportunity for China to come out with territorial claims against
India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved in further into Ladakh and established
themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal, just South of Dambu Guru. On 08
September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Post in the Eastern Sector and
began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in the Eastern Sector in Namka Chu
Sector as well as in the Western Sector in Ladakh. The overwhelming number of the Chinese

Established on 01 January 1764, the Bengal Presidency Medical Service, which was the first
military service of the three Presidencies in India. The Indian Army Medical Corps came into
existence as a homogeneous corps of officers and men on the pattern of the Royal Army
Medical Corps on 03 April 1943 by the amalgamation of the Indian Medical Service (IMS),
the Indian Medical Department (IMD) and the Indian Hospital & Nursing Corps. It was
renamed as Army Medical Corps after the Independence. The Corps was formed as a wartime
necessity for attracting suitably qualified men for service in a rapidly expanding army.2 The
Army Medical Corps has been a part of all combat and active operations that Indian Army was
involved in. It has excelled in providing both peace time and combat health care to the defence
forces, medical services to UN peace keeping forces in foreign missions and during disaster
management to civil authorities.3 The Corps has the motto of “Sarve Santu Niramaya” meaning
“Let all be free from disease and disability”.

The KUMAON Regiment traces its origins to the 18th Century and has fought in every major
campaign of the British Indian Army and the Indian Army including the two World Wars.
During World War I, a Kumaon Battalion was raised at Ranikhet on 23 October 1917 as
34/39th Kumaon Rifles. In 1918, it was redesigned as 1st Battalion, 50th Kumaon Rifles and a
second Battalion was raised. These were merged with Hyderabad contingent into the 19th
Hyderabad Regiment in 1923. On 27 October 1945, the 19th Hyderabad was renamed as 19
Kumaon Regiment. Post Independence, it has been known as the Kumaon Regiment. Staying
true to the Regimental motto of Parakramo Vijayate (Valour Triumphs) the Regiment has
proved its mettle in Indo-Pak War of 1947-48, Sino-India War of 1962, Indo-Pak War 1971,
Kargil War of 1999 and also participated in the Indian Peace-keeping Force in Sri Lanka.
During the Sino-India War of 1962, 13 KUMAON displayed conspicuous courage and
undaunted determination while fighting the enemy during the Battle of Rezang La, whereMajor Shaitan Singh was awarded the Param Vir Chakra.1 The KUMAON Regiment has
contributed three Chiefs to the Indian Army namely General SM Shringesh, General KS
Thimayya, DSO and General TN Raina, MVC.
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after
its establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant
diplomatic status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state
recognition of PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into
negotiations with China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement
in 1954. Within a few weeks of Chou Enlai’s visit to India in 1954, the Chinese launched a
protest against the presence of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometers South of a border
pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the first time, the Government of China laid claim
to any part of Indian territory formally. The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957
marked a turning point in the Sino-India relations as the Chinese occupied a large part of the
Aksai Chin. This opened an opportunity for China to come out with territorial claims against
India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved in further into Ladakh and established
themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal, just South of Dambu Guru. On 08
September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Post in the Eastern Sector and
began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in the Eastern Sector in Namka Chu
Sector as well as in the Western Sector in Ladakh. The overwhelming number of the Chinese
troops attacked the Indian soldiers but they fought the enemy with grit and determination. The
Chinese announced the cease-fire at midnight of 21/22 November 1962.2 During the war, the
NEFA was a hub of enemy invasions.

On 09 September 1962, India's then - Defence Minister Shri Krishna Menon decided to evict
the Chinese troops stationed South of Thagla Ridge due to the increasing intensity of Chinese
incursions into Indian Territory. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's then Prime Minister,
who was in London for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, agreed with this
decision. The 7 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier JP Dalvi was then given the order
to advance to Namka Chu, which was considered as an advantageous ground for the Chinese.
Being aware of this advantage, Chinese attacked the Indian Post at Namka Chu on 20 October
1962 with overwhelming strength. The Indian Army fought the assault but were soon
overpowered by enemy’s strength in number and superior weapons.
On the eve of their attack on 19-20 October night, the Chinese had about four Battalions South
of the Thag La Ridge and two Companies in the vicinity of Khinzemane. They had also moved
a Battalion to Shao and nearly another Battalion to the subsidiary passes between Thag La and
Karpola II. The Chinese were also holding the rear positions between Thag La and Marmang
in depth. By 20 October, the Chinese had built up their strength to an estimated one Division
in the Thag La and Khinzemane areas. It was also reported that they had positioned an
additional Division in Bum La area. They had access to three routes (tracks) to reach Tawang.
The rapid and heavy build-up of the Chinese troops, armed with heavy mortars and MachineGuns and equipped with modern entrenching tools, had forced the Indian Government to
postpone the operation to evict the Chinese from their illegal encroachment, North of the
Namka Chu. It was felt that the task would, for the time being, have to be limited to holding
the Namka Chu. 7 Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier JP Dalvi, with its Headquarters
at Rongla was provided with four Infantry Battalions, less two Companies. They were 9
PUNJAB, 4 GRENADIERS, 2 RAJPUTS AND 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES along with some
Artillery.
The Chinese, who had been subjecting the Indian Post at Tsang Le on the North Bank of Namka
Chu, to heavy shelling since 17 October, but left this Post alone when at 0500 hours on 20
October, they engaged other Posts all along the Namkha Chu by heavy mortar fire. In the very
first few artillery barrages, telephone lines, linking the Brigade Headquarters with the units,
went dead, leaving the Units/Companies on their own and take any action they considered the
best. Brigade Headquarters was informed by the Dhola Post had been completely over run by
the Chinese.
Walong in the Lohit Frontier Division was another area in Arunachal Pradesh witnessing major
and intense fighting. In march 1962, 6 KUMAON was ordered to relieve 2 RAJPUT and the
complete operational responsibility was taken over by 6 KUMOAN on 21 April. During the
War, in October 1962, Army Head Quarters asked the Eastern Command to consider
withdrawing bulk of the troops from Subansiri, Siang and Lohit Frontier Divisions. They were
also asked to consider using the entire 23 Infantry Division to contain he enemy thrust from
Walong. 2 Infantry Division was formed to take over operational responsibility in Subansiri,
Siang and Lohit Frontier Divisions of NEFA, its GOC, Major General M S Pathania, arrived
at Walong on 26 October to the forward areas. With two battalions located at Walong but
without a coordinating HQ located nearby, the new GOC found inherent problems of command
and control of troops in the Walong Sector. Accordingly, on 29 October 1962, it was decided
that operations in the Walong Sector would be looked after by an independent Infantry Brigade.
For this purpose, first 181 Infantry Brigade and finally 11 Infantry Brigade (then located in
Nagaland) was placed under 2 Infantry Division. The new Brigade Commander, Brigadier N
C Rawlley, MC, arrived in Walong on 31 October and the same evening he called for a
conference of his COs and told them: “There was going to be no withdrawal from this place –
everybody must get that straight”.Operations in Walong Sector during 1962 Sino India War

The presence of the enemy on the Green and Yellow Pimples in the Sector was cause of concern
as Green Pimple dominated Lachhman Ridge and Maha Plateau. The approach to Green Pimple
was through Tri-junction and Yellow Pimple. Moreover, advance of another three km along
that Spur by the enemy meant his domination of Walong Airstrip and Dropping Zone.
Anticipating the danger from the enemy, 'A' Company of 6 KUMAON under Captain Ravi
Kumar Mathur was sent on 05 November 1962 to clear the enemy from area Green Pimple and
then to reconnoitre the route from Green Pimple to Ashi Hill. He was personally briefed by
Brigadier Rawlley. The Company was to get fire support from heavy mortars of 71 Battery and
on that day the Battery fired 110 rounds on Green Pimple, Yellow Pimple and left edge of
Maha Plateau.On 14 November 196, Second Lieutenant Amar Singh Khattri was a Company Officer of 6
KUMAON which launched a Counter Attack against a well-sited and dug in Chinese defence
positions on Yellow Pimple in NEFA. In the early stages of the attack the Company
Commander was wounded and evacuated. Lieutenant Khattri assumed command of the
Company. Under his courageous leadership and personal example, the company continued to
make slow but steady advance against very heavy opposition. Lieutenant Khattri personally
went forward to the leading sections to spur and guide them on continually exposing himself
to enemy fire. Even when the advance was finally held up, he did his utmost to try to break
through the bunker positions. At 0130 hours on 15 November 1962, the enemy launched a
fierce counter attack and almost over-ran his company. Though heavily outnumbered, he
quickly rallied his men and tried to hold the Chinese attack. Even when he pulled back, he did
so very slowly, fighting for every inch of the ground. At times, he was up with the last Light
Machine Gun, personally directing the fire and indicating new positions to be taken up. In the
face of very heavy odds, he delayed the enemy advance for over three hours. Finally, he halted
the enemy less than hundred yards below Tri-junction Hill, but was wounded by grenade
thrown from about 15 yards.
Throughout this action, Second Lieutenant Khattri displayed courage and leadership of a very
high order. He was awarded Vir Chakra for his great devotion to duty and gallantry.","Second Lieutenant Amar Singh Khattri, (IC-12970) The Kumaon Regiment

The PUNJAB Regiment, is among the oldest Regiments in the Indian Army, it traces its origins
back to 1805 when the First Battalion was raised under the Maharaja of Patiala. Originally, the
Regiment comprised four British-raised Battalions. The numbers and titles of the Battalions
changed during the successive reorganisations of the Madras Presidency Army, the British
Indian Army and the Indian Army during 18th, 19th and 20th Century. After the 1857 War of
Independence, the British applied the martial races theory and North Indian troops replaced the
South Indians. Post Independence, the PUNJAB Regiment of India was formed from the 2nd
Punjab Regiment of the British Indian Army. In 1951, four battle experienced Battalions of the
former Princely states of Punjab, joined the Regiment. These battalions were from the Jind and
Nabha State Forces and the first and second Battalions of Patiala Infantry. They were
designated as the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th battalions of the PUNJAB Regiment. Additional
Battalions have been raised since 1963. Since 1947, the PUNJAB Regiment has taken part in
various battle sand wars, winning numerous honours and awards for the same. The Regimental
Centre of the Regiment was first raised at Loralai and was shifted to Multan in 1922, Meerut
in 1929 and at last to its present location in Ramgarh, Jharkhand in 1976.1 During the Sino-
India war of 1962, the Regiment was deployed in the North-East Frontier Agency Sector

During the 1962 Sino-India War, the North East Frontier Agency (NEFA) was a hub of enemy
invasions. In early September, the Government of India ordered immediate evacuation of
enemy troops from the NEFA. On 24 September Lieutenant General Umrao Singh, who was
the Corps Commander conveyed the orders to Major General Niranjan Prasad, GOC 4 Infantry
Division who then made sure that the energies of Indian Army in the area was directed to

of capturing a small feature on Thag La slopes, and Tseng-Jong, then roll down West to East
to the Chinese positions on the Namka Chu. However soon the responsibility of NEFA was
handed over to IV CORPS commanded by Lieutenant General B M Kaul, the CGS. Acting

came on 10 October 1962. When groups of men from 2 RAJPUT were moving up the Southern
Bank of the Namkha Chu, making for Bridge III on their way to Log Bridge - the planned

During the Sino-India War of 1962, Company Havildar Major Anant Ram was deployed in Daulat
Beg Oldi (DBO) Sub-Sector of Northern Ladakh. DBO was a vitally important post since four
tracks radiated from it. The old Silk Route went north, crossed the Karakoram Pass (5575 meters)
and went on to Yarkand in Sinkiang. The other two routes connected DBO to Leh, over 200
kilometres away, and requiring at least twelve days of long and difficult marching to reach it. Th
Eastern or Winter route went due South from DB0 crossing the Track Junction, Chip Chap River
and the Depsang a Plains to reach the Murgo Post. 14 J&K Militia (now LADHAK SCOUTS) was

17, 1962 reports of heavy Chinese concentration opposite our Post Chandani started coming in.
This concentration of Chinese was so heavy that it posed a threat to entire area of Chip Chap and
Kara Koram.

DBO itself had the Battalion Headquarters and nearly a Company strength. The rest of the available
force was distributed on two possible approached. Chip Chap River valley had a total of ten Posts.
Chip Chap Posts 1 to 4 were located North of the river Chip Chap, while Posts 5 to 10 were to the
south. Posts 10 to 14 guarded the approach from an uncharted river valley further south. Inaddition, there were some troops in Murgo, Sultan Chushku, Track Junction, and all the way down
to Shyok village, to provide staging posts for supply as well as the columns that regularly moved
between the main base at Leh and DBO. Out of these twenty-one Posts, DBO had a Company
strength and also Posts 1 and 4 on the North of Chip Chap River had a Platoon each (roughly 25
to 30 men). Posts 5, 7 and 14 also had Platoon each. Rest of the Posts had Section strength (between
10 to 15). These Posts were dependent upon DBO for their supply. All the Posts were equipped
only with small arms with the exception of Post 1 that had a Section of 3-inch mortars. The Posts
thus were not in a position to dominate more than 500 meters distance around them, this being the
effective range of the Light Machine Guns. average distance between the Posts was 2 to 3 kms and
some like Post 14 were nearly 10 to 12 kms away from nearest Indian Posts. There was thus no
possibility of mutual support.
The Chinese had been building up their strength In the Sector from July 1962 onwards. The vicinity
of Indian Post No 4 enabled them to bring in their heavy weapons very close to our posts. On 19
October 1962, all the Indian Posts near Chip Chap were dominated by the Chinese in superior
strength.

Around 0230 hours on 20 October, the Chinese brought pressure against Posts 2 and 3 manned by,
5 JAT located on the Northern bank of Chip Chap River and the personnel of these two Posts were
asked to fall back on Post 4. Company Havildar Major Anant Ram was in command of a Post inLadakh on peak more than 18,000 feet high. When the Chinese started an attack on this post, CHM
Anant Ram had only twelve men under his command. The Chinese shelled the post for 45 minutes
and destroyed all the bunkers. Two of the twelve men on the Post were killed. Nearly 300 Chinese
then closed in on the Post but every man stuck to his position. Under CHM Anant Ram's leadership,
the men fought tenaciously and inflicted more than 100 casualties on the enemy but the Chinese
cut off and surrounded the Post. With great skill and courage CHM Anant Ram extricated the
remaining eight of his men down sheer precipice and though suffering from frostbite ultimately
managed to report to a Post at Daulet Beg Oldi. CHM Anant Ram displayed courage, devotion to
duty and leadership of a high order in the best traditions of the Army and was awarded Vir Chakra.
In the battles of Daulat Beg Oldi Sub Sector, Indian troops fought valiantly despite having scarcity
of resources and being outnumbered by the Chinese troops. In the fight of Post 1 (Chandani) or
Post 4, Subedar Sonam Stopdan and Havildar Saroop Singh of the 14 J&K Militia made the
supreme sacrifice after taking heavy toll of the enemy. Both were honored with the nation's second
highest gallantry award, the Maha Vir Chakra. Major Sardul Singh Randhawa was decorated with

5831357,Havildar,Kaula Singh Thapa,1/9 GORKHA RIFLES,"Havildar Kaula Singh Thapa, was born on 01 July 1925 in Urleni Village of Gulmi District, Nepal.
His parent’s names were Naina Singh and Puni Kala. He joined 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES of the
Indian Army on 12 November 1943 at the young age of eighteen. During the Sino India War of
1962, Havildar Kaula Singh Thapa fought at Northern slopes of Tsangdhar in North East Frontier
Agency (NEFA) against the overwhelming hordes of Chinese. He fought the enemy with great
sense of duty and sacrificed himself for the nation.
The first Battalion of Gurkha Regiment (now GORKHA RIFLES) was raised in 1815 during the
Anglo-Nepalese war. Impressed by the qualities displayed by Gurkhas during the war, the British
started active recruitment of Gurkhas into the British Indian army. After the partition, in 1947 six
Gurkha regiments viz, 1 GR, 3 GR, 4 GR, 5 GR, 8 GR and 9 GR remained with the Indian Army,
while 2 GR, 6 GR, 7 GR and 10 GR were transferred to British Army as part of the Tripartite
Agreement signed between India, Nepal and Britain. The 9 GORKHA RIFLES was raised in 1817
at Infantry Levy at Fatehgarh as Fatehgarh Levy. In 1823, it became 63rd Regiment a regular unit
as part of the Bengal Native Infantry. Following the reorganisation after 1857, the designation was
changed to 9th Bengal Native Infantry with one of its companies formed by Gorkhas and other
hillmen. In 1893, the regiment became a wholly Gorkha unit before finally designated as 9th
GORKHA RIFLES in 1903. The Regiment fought in Europe during World War I and in Italy and
North West Frontier during World War II. Since independence, the regiment has proved its mettle
in Sino-India War of 1962 where it fought under the most demanding conditions on the Namka
Chu in NEFA (Now Arunachal Pradesh). Later, the Regiment was also involved in Indo-Pak War
of 1965 and 1971. The Regiment’s motto is ‘Kafar Hunu Bhanda Marnu Ramro’ (Better to die
than live like a coward).
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after its
establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant diplomatic
status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state recognition
of PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into negotiations with
China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement in 1954. Within a few
weeks of Chou Enlai’s visit to India in 1954, the Chinese launched a protest against the presence
of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometers south of a border pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh.
This was the first time, the Government of China laid claim to any part of Indian territory formally.
The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957 marked a turning point in the Sino-India
relations as the Chinese occupied a large part of the Aksai Chin. This opened an opportunity for
China to come out with territorial claims against India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved
in further into Ladakh and established themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal, just
south of Dambu Guru. On 08 September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Postin the Eastern sector and began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in the Eastern
Sector in Namka Chu sector as well as in the Western Sector in Ladakh. While an overwhelming
number of the Chinese troops attacked the Indian soldiers but they fought the enemy with grit and
determination. The Chinese announced the cease-fire at midnight of 21/22 November 1962.1
On 09 September 1962, India's then-Defence Minister Krishna Menon decided to evict the Chinese
troops stationed South of Thagla Ridge due to the increasing intensity of Chinese incursions into
Indian territory. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's then Prime Minister, who was in London
for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, agreed with this decision. 7 Infantry Brigade
commanded by Brigadier JP Dalvi was then given the order to advance to Namka Chu, which was
considered as an advantageous ground for the Chinese. Being aware of this advantage, Chinese
attacked the Indian post at Namka Chu on 20 October 1962 with overwhelming strength. The
Indian Army fought the assault but was soon overpowered by enemy’s strength in number and
superior weapons.
On the eve of their attack on the night of 19-20 October, the Chinese had about four Battalions
South of Thag La Ridge and two Companies in the vicinity of Khinzemane. They had moved a
battalion to Shao and another battalion to the subsidiary passes between Thag La and Karpola II.
Along with holding a rear position between Thag La and Marmang in depth, Chinese had also
infiltrated the Tsangdhar area. Chinese had started subjecting the Indian post at Tsangle on the
north bank of Namka Chu to heavy shelling since 17 October. However, they left this post alone
in early hours of 20 October and engaged other posts all along Namka Chu by heavy mortar fire.
And between 0600 Hr and 0700 Hr they attacked Tsangdhar area, Bridge 3 (on Namka Chu) and
Dhola with aim to cut off the Indian troops. 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES was deployed to hold positions
on the Northern slopes of Tsangdhar during the attack. The Gorkhas fought as hard as they could
but to their surprise first, they were attacked from the flanks and later from the rear.

Chinese soldiers attacked the left flank of the position held by 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES in the
Tsangdhar area of NEFA at dawn on 20 October 1962, following a period of heavy bombardment.
On this flank, the platoon of Second Lieutenant Bhagwan Dutt Dogra was guarding a track that
led to his company's position. Havildar Kaula Singh Thapa had positioned himself in the left
Section Light Machine Gun pit so as to prevent enemy penetration from the left flank. When a
Rifleman was killed by a burst from enemy automatic rifle, Havildar Kaula Singh Thapa
immediately took charge of the Light Machine Gun. He kept on firing it and inflicted heavy
casualties on the enemy. After sometime the tempo of the enemy attack increased, by then only
three full Light Machine Gun magazines were left. The position was untenable and Havildar Thapa
was ordered to withdraw. He asked his Platoon to withdraw and himself undertook to provide
covering fire. Completely disregarding his own safety, he stuck to his gun till the Chinese overran
his position and he was killed.
Throughout the action, Havildar Kaula Singh Thapa displayed a high sense of duty, leadership and
courage in the best traditions of the Army. He was awarded Vir Chakra posthumously.","5831357 Havildar Kaula Singh Thapa, 9 GORKHA RIFLES (Posthumous)

1962 with overwhelming strength. The Indian Army fought the assault but were soon
overpowered by enemy’s strength in number and superior weapons.
On the eve of their attack on 19-20 October night, the Chinese had about four Battalions South
of the Thag La Ridge and two Companies in the vicinity of Khinzemane. They had also moved
a Battalion to Shao and nearly another Battalion to the subsidiary passes between Thag La and
Karpola II. The Chinese were also holding the rear positions between Thag La and Marmang
in depth. By 20 October, the Chinese had built up their strength to an estimated one Division
in the Thag La and Khinzemane areas. It was also reported that they had positioned an
additional Division in Bum La area. They had access to three routes (tracks) to reach Tawang.
The rapid and heavy build-up of the Chinese troops, armed with heavy mortars and MachineGuns and equipped with modern entrenching tools, had forced the Indian Government to
postpone the operation to evict the Chinese from their illegal encroachment, North of the
Namka Chu. It was felt that the task would, for the time being, have to be limited to holding
the Namka Chu. 7 Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier JP Dalvi, with its Headquarters
at Rongla was provided with four Infantry Battalions, less two Companies. They were 9
PUNJAB, 4 GRENADIERS, 2 RAJPUT AND 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES along with some
Artillery.
The Chinese, who had been subjecting the Indian Post at Tsang Le on the North Bank of Namka
Chu, to heavy shelling since 17 October, but left this Post alone when at 0500 hours on 20
October, they engaged other Posts all along the Namkha Chu by heavy mortar fire. In the very
first few Artillery barrages, telephone lines, linking the Brigade Headquarters with the units,
went dead, leaving the Units/Companies on their own and take any action they considered the
best. Brigade Headquarters was informed by the Dhola Post had been completely over run by
the Chinese. The troops in Zimithang-Khinzemane area were directly under Tactical
Headquarters 4 Infantry Division at Zimithang. On 20 October at 0400 hours, when the
ASSAM RIFLES men were still in ""Stand To"", the Chinese fired star shells over Khinzemane
and the whole area got illuminated. The men fought gallantly but could not stand for long due
to numerical superiority of the enemy. By the afternoon of 20 October, the Chinese had driven
back all the Indian troops from Bridges 1 to 5 along the Namka Chu, Tsangle (North of Namka
Chu across Bridge 5), Khinzemane (above the junction of Namka Chu with Nyamjang Chu)
and Tsangdhar.
On 20th October 1962, 4 GRENADIERS was ordered to withdraw from a forward Post in
NEFA. Lance Naik Sardar was Second in Command of a Section which was deployed on the
extreme right flank of a Company. The Chinese forces, approximately a Company strong had
established itself on the opposite bank of the Namka Chu river and had cut the withdrawal route
by dominating the track leading back to Hathungla Pass. Lance Naik Sardar Singh Platoon was
given the task of guarding the right flank of the Battalion position so as to prevent enemy
interference with the withdrawal. Being in the forward most Section, he ensued that the Section
kept on firing at the enemy. He himself remained in the position till the whole Company had
collected at the rendezvous. He, however, fell a victim to an enemy bullet.
Throughout the action, Lance Naik Sardar Singh displayed courage and devotion to duty of
high order. He was awarded Vir Chakra posthumously.. Lance Naik Sardar Singh’s relatives paying homage to his statue.

During the Sino-India War of 1962, Company Havildar Major Anant Ram was deployed in Daulat
Beg Oldi (DBO) Sub-Sector of Northern Ladakh. DBO was a vitally important post since four
tracks radiated from it. The old Silk Route went north, crossed the Karakoram Pass (5575 meters)
and went on to Yarkand in Sinkiang. The other two routes connected DBO to Leh, over 200
kilometres away, and requiring at least twelve days of long and difficult marching to reach it. The
Eastern or Winter route went due South from DB0 crossing the Track Junction, Chip Chap River
and the Depsang a Plains to reach the Murgo Post. 14 J&K Militia (now LADHAK SCOUTS) was

17, 1962 reports of heavy Chinese concentration opposite our Post Chandani started coming in.
This concentration of Chinese was so heavy that it posed a threat to entire area of Chip Chap and
Kara Koram.

DBO itself had the Battalion Headquarters and nearly a Company strength. The rest of the available
force was distributed on two possible approached. Chip Chap River valley had a total of ten Posts.
Chip Chap Posts 1 to 4 were located North of the river Chip Chap, while Posts 5 to 10 were to theSouth. Posts 10 to 14 guarded the approach from an uncharted river valley further south. In
addition, there were some troops in Murgo, Sultan Chushku, Track Junction, and all the way down
to Shyok village, to provide Staging Posts for supply as well as the columns that regularly moved
between the main base at Leh and DBO. Out of these twenty-one Posts, DBO had a Company
strength and also Posts 1 and 4 on the North of Chip Chap River had a Platoon each (roughly 25
to 30 men). Posts 5, 7 and 14 also had Platoon each. Rest of the Posts had Section strength (between
10 to 15). These Posts were dependent upon DBO for their supply. All the Posts were equipped
only with small arms with the exception of Post 1 that had a Section of 3-inch mortars. The Posts
thus were not in a position to dominate more than 500 meters distance around them, this being the
effective range of the Light Machine Guns. average distance between the Posts was 2 to 3 kms and
some like Post 14 were nearly 10 to 12 kms away from nearest Indian Posts. There was thus no
possibility of mutual support.
The Chinese had been building up their strength In the Sector from July 1962 onwards. The vicinity
of Indian Post No 4 enabled them to bring in their heavy weapons very close to our posts. On 19
October 1962, all the Indian Posts near Chip Chap were dominated by the Chinese in superior
strength.

China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after its
establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant diplomatic
status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state recognition
of PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into negotiations with
China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement in 1954. Within a few
weeks of Chou Enlai’s visit to India in 1954, the Chinese launched a protest against the presence
of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometers south of a border pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh.
This was the first time, the Government of China laid claim to any part of Indian territory formally.
The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957 marked a turning point in the Sino-India
relations as the Chinese occupied a large part of the Aksai Chin. This opened an opportunity for
China to come out with territorial claims against India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved
in further into Ladakh and established themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal, just
south of Dambu Guru. On 08 September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Post
in the Eastern Sector and began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in the Eastern
Sector in Namka Chu Sector as well as in the Western Sector in Ladakh. The overwhelming
number of the Chinese troops attacked the Indian soldiers but they fought the enemy with grit anddetermination. The Chinese announced the cease-fire at midnight of 21/22 November 1962.1
During the war, the NEFA was a hub of enemy invasions.

troops stationed South of Thagla Ridge due to the increasing intensity of Chinese incursions into
Indian Territory. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's then Prime Minister, who was in London

commanded by Brigadier JP Dalvi was then given the order to advance to Namka Chu, which was
considered as an advantageous ground for the Chinese. Being aware of this advantage, Chinese
attacked the Indian Post at Namka Chu on 20 October 1962 with overwhelming strength. The
Indian Army fought the assault but were soon overpowered by enemy’s strength in number and
superior weapons.

Government of India.On the eve of their attack on 19-20 October night, the Chinese had about four Battalions South of
the Thag La Ridge and two Companies in the vicinity of Khinzemane. They had also moved a
Battalion to Shao and nearly another Battalion to the subsidiary passes between Thag La and
Karpola II. The Chinese were also holding the rear positions between Thag La and Marmang In
depth. By 20 October, the Chinese had built up their strength to an estimated one Division in the
Thag La and Khinzemane areas. It was also reported that they had positioned an additional
Division in Bum La area. They had access to three routes (tracks) to reach Tawang. The rapid and
heavy build-up of the Chinese troops, armed with heavy mortars and Machine Guns and equipped
with modern entrenching tools, had forced the Indian Government to postpone the operation to
evict the Chinese from their illegal encroachment, North of the Namka Chu. It was felt that the
task would, for the time being, have to be limited to holding the Namka Chu.
After the Indian troops vacated Tawang on 23 October 1962, the Chinese occupied it. Chinese
stopped their push North of Tawang Chu. There was then a lull in fighting in Kameng Sector which
lasted a little over three weeks. The period of lull was utilised by the invaders in making
preparations for further thrust into Indian territory beyond Tawang. 4 GARHWAL RIFLES, which
covered the withdrawal the Tawang garrison across the Tawang Chu had suffered from confusion
and disorder on reaching South of the river. But they were halted, re-grouped together and the
situation was stabilised. They then occupied a Delaying Position at Jang where they battled with
the Chinese, inflicted casualties on the enemy and when the defence of the Bridge 4 over Tawang
Chhu became untenable they, as per plan, got it demolished on 24 October 1962.

be prepared to stay for the on-coming winter in its Delaying Position. The Garhwali’s thus settled
down in the Nuranang area to perform their duties as Covering Troops for main defences of 62
Infantry Brigade Sector. They were to hold the area. During the period 24 October - 16 November
1962; 4 GARHWAL RIFLES carried out aggressive patrolling in this area. They harassed enemy
on the other side of the river by directing Howitzer shelling on their concentrations.
On the morning of 16 November at around 1000 hours; a patrol led by Jemadar Partap Singh
Rawat, Platoon Commander of ‘A’ Company which was occupying the forward most position in
the 4 GARWAL Defended Area, reported heavy enemy concentration in area Lhau across the
Tawang Chu. The Patrol also reported, at 1800 hours, that the enemy was constructing a bridge
over the river near the old Bridge 4 which was demolished earlier. At about 0500 hours on 17
November, Jemadar Gabar Singh Rawat, who was defending the right forward position of ‘A'
Company, was informed by his Observation Post that some men were advancing the road towards
the defences. At about the same time, noise of mine explosion was heard from the West flank of
the Company. It became clear that the Chinese were launching an attack. Jemadar Rawat and his
party lobbed a few grenades on the approaching enemy, and made their way back to the Company
under covering fire from the forward defended localities. The Chinese were now moving towards
the defences, and attacked in a series of waves for about 30 minutes under cover of mortar fire.
There attacks were beaten back with heavy casualties to the enemy. The enemy was then seen
withdrawing the rear, possibly to reorganise the situation.The bunkers occupied by 4 Garhwal Rifles just north of Bridge 3 flanking the Nuranang Chu.

Defended Locality at Nuranang. On 17 November 1962, the Chinese attacked this locality with
heavy mortar and automatic small arms. The attack was unsuccessful and the enemy, although in
superior number, suffered heavy casualties. Later, on the same day, the Chinese launched a fierce
attack in overwhelming numbers from three directions. Jemadar Gusain saw a shell bursting near
one of his LMG posts and noticed that his LMG had ceased firing. Realising the danger to the
weakened flank, he crawled from his Command Post and saw the two LMG gunners badly
wounded. He then himself handled the LMG and kept on firing till the attack was repulsed by his
platoon. Later on, when he started evacuating the wounded men to his Company Headquarters, he
noticed Naik Ranjit Singh Gusan, the Section Commander of this LMG Post also lying
unconscious in an open trench with bullet wound in his head. He personally brough the NCO to
the Company Headquarters.
The next day, Jemadar Gusain was detailed to destroy an enemy LMG firing from High Ground
near Nyuk Madong. After survey of the area, he found the LMG sited between some rocks. Heasked his Section to cover him and crawled behind the enemy and destroyed the LMG with hand
grenades. When the Companies were regrouping and were about to resume the advance they were
surrounded by the enemy in large numbers. Our troops were later cut off in small pockets due to
heavy shelling and trapped in large ambush after which the sub-units lost contact with each other.
Jemadar Gusain, in utter disregard of his own safety, collected 41 men and successfully fought
them out of the ambush.
In these operations, Jemadar Jatan Singh Gusain displayed courage, devotion to duty and

broken up. This assault lasted for about twenty minutes. Having failed, the enemy withdrew again,
leaving more casualties in front. The enemy having regrouped and reorganised, once again
launched assault on ‘A’ Company locality at 0910 hours. The Battalion successfully repulsed the
enemy attack again, inflicting heavy casualties. As the ‘A’ Company of the Battalion occupied the

launched their most determined attack from three directions; front and both the flanks preceded by
very heavy shelling, at 1055 hours. The attackers came very close to the forward trenches of the

November, Jemadar Gabar Singh Rawat, who was defending the right forward position of ‘A'
Company, was informed by his Observation Post that some men were advancing the road towards
the defences. At about the same time, noise of mine explosion was heard from the West flank of
the Company. It became clear that the Chinese were launching an attack. Jemadar Rawat and his
party lobbed a few grenades on the approaching enemy, and made their way back to the Company
under covering fire from the forward defended localities. The Chinese were now moving towards
the defences, and attacked in a series of waves for about 30 minutes under cover of mortar fire.
There attacks were beaten back with heavy casualties to the enemy. The enemy was then seen
withdrawing the rear, possibly to reorganise the situation.
On 17 November, the enemy launched fresh attack at about 0745 hours. This time, the attack was
preceded by heavy mortar and artillery fire. The Centre and Right flanks of the Garhwalis came
under heavy pressure. It was again mainly due to the hand grenades, that the enemy attack was
broken up. This assault lasted for about twenty minutes. Having failed, the enemy withdrew again,
leaving more casualties in front. The enemy having regrouped and reorganised, once again
launched assault on ‘A’ Company locality at 0910 hours. The Battalion successfully repulsed the
enemy attack again, inflicting heavy casualties. As the ‘A’ Company of the Battalion occupied the
forward-most location of the Battalion Defended Area, the enemy could not attack other
Company's locations without over-running 'A' Coy first. The Chinese once again formed up and
launched their most determined attack from three directions; front and both the flanks preceded by
very heavy shelling, at 1055 hours. The attackers came very close to the forward trenches of the
front Platoon. Naik Ranjeet Singh Gusain, seeing an imminent danger, came out of his bunker to
an open trench, and threw hand grenades very effectively on the assaulting enemy.The bunkers occupied by 4 Garhwal Rifles just north of Bridge 3 flanking the Nuranang Chu.
The place is now known as Jaswantgarh. In the background are the slopes on the Tawang side of

The enemy managed to bring forward and site a Medium Machine Gun within thirty meters to the
left flank of the Indian position, and simultaneously continued attacking in wave after wave. The
‘A’ Coy Commander sent Lance Naik Trilok Singh Negi, Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat and
Rifleman Gopal Singh Gusain, who volunteered to destroy the MMG. Rifleman Gopal Singh
Gusain was a member of ‘D’ Section commanded by Lance Naik Trilok Singh Negi which was
defending the left tear flank of the Company. After three unsuccessful attacks, the enemy
succeeded in bringing a Medium Machine Gun very close to the number three Platoon and started
heavy fire. Realising that the position held by number three Platoon would become untenable soon
if the enemy MMG was not destroyed forthwith. Lance Naik Trilok Singh Negi, Rifleman Gopal
Singh Gosain and Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat volunteered to go and destroy it. They crawled
forward under the risk of our own as well as enemy fire and reached with 10 to 15 yards of the
target. While Lance Naik Trilok Sigh Negi undertook covering fire with his Sten gun, Rifleman
Jaswant Singh Rawat and Rifleman Gopal Sigh Gusain hurled grenades on the enemy MMG. The
grenades exploded and without losing time both of them rushed towards the MMG position They
saw two Chinese lying dead and another, though badly wounded, still holding the MMG. They

2818454,Rifleman,Jethoo Singh,4 Rajputana Rifles,"Rifleman Jethoo Singh, was native of a village named Jhimal, Tehsil Lachhmangarh, in Sikar
district of Rajasthan, India. His father’s name was Shri Kal Singh. He enrolled into the Indian
Army in the Rajputana Rifles on 4 March 1961.
The Rajputana Rifles was raised in 1921 as 6th Rajputana Rifles following the merger of six British
Indian army regiments. In 1945 the numeral sign “6” was dropped and it became the Rajputana
Rifles. It is India’s first rifle regiment. A rifle regiment is so called because all infantry troops in
the regiment were armed with rifles. This was at a time when most soldiers fought with muskets
or swords. The soldiers of a rifle regiment were known as riflemen. The area of Rajputana
comprises of more than 20 princely states, notably Bikaner, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur, and Ajmer,
during the British rule. All these states merged with the Indian Union following independence in
1947. The Regiment has a fair combination of Jat and Rajput. The battle cry of the Rajputana
Rifles is “Raja Ramchandra ki Jai” (Hail Lord Rama). 4 RAJ RIF was part of 99 Infantry Brigade
Group in ONUC from 1961-63.
The Republic of Congo (now Democratic Republic of Congo) gained independence from its
colonial master, Belgium, in 1960. However, the newly independent nation soon descended into a
series of conflicts. The Congolese government appealed to the United Nations (UN) for aid and
assistance of a multilateral force to contain the violence and maintain peace in the strife-torn
country. The ONUC was established on 14 July 1960 under the United Nations Security Council
Resolution 143. The initial mandate of ONUC was to ensure the withdrawal of Belgian forces
from the Republic of the Congo, assist the Congolese government in maintaining law and order,
and provide technical assistance. Subsequently, ONUC became embroiled in a chaotic internal
situation of extreme complexity and had to be converted into an UN peacekeeping operation which
allowed limited use of military force. The Force was designed to protect the Congo from outside
interference, particularly by evacuating foreign mercenaries and advisers from Katanga and
preventing clashes and civil strife, by force, if necessary, as a last resort. In 1961-62, secessionist
gendarmes under the command of foreign mercenaries clashed with the UN Force. At its peak,
ONUC had 20,000 troops, including a brigade from India. In February 1963, after Katanga had
been reintegrated into the national territory of Congo, ONUC began to be phased out. It was finally
dissolved on 30 June 1964.
Rifleman Jethoo Singh’s platoon was leading the attack along the Elisabethville-Jadotville Road
in Congo. Soon after the attack, his platoon received heavy and sustained mortar, medium machine
gun and small arm fire from three directions. On his right, an enemy light machine gun post opened
fire on the Company Commander’s party that was following him. Rifleman Jethoo Singh along
with another rifleman charged at the enemy post that consequently led to an unfortunate direct buston the chest of the second rifleman, causing his instant demise. Upon witnessing the death of his
comrade, Rifleman Jethoo Singh single handedly rushed forward alone to silence the enemy light
machine gun post. As he was about 20 yards from the post, on his way to the post he was mortally
wounded, but before he died, he threw a hand grenade on the enemy light machine gun post, killed
two of the enemy and silenced it.

The origin of the Madras regiment in its present form can be traced to the time when the Levis
were organised into companies of 100 men each, and two battalions were thus raised on 4
December 1758 and placed under the command of Lord Robert Clive to defend Fort St. George at
Madras. Thus, the Madras Regiment became one of the oldest regiments of the Indian Infantry.

Telangana and Karnataka. The valour of the Madras Regiment was seen when it fought fierce
battles during most military operations of independent India. Their regimental war cry is “Veer

Punjab. He was enrolled in 9 PUNJAB of the Indian Army on 11 May 1950 at the age of
seventeen. During the Sino India War of 1962, Havildar Malkiat Singh was deployed in the
NEFA Sector where he fought the Chinese in the battle of Tseng-Jong and sacrificed himself
for the nation. He was awarded Vir Chakra posthumously.
The PUNJAB Regiment, is amongst the oldest Regiments in the Indian Army and traces its
origins back to 1805 when the First Battalion was raised under the Maharaja of Patiala.
Originally, the Regiment comprised four British-raised Battalions. The numbers and titles of
the Battalions changed during the successive reorganisations of the Madras Presidency Army,
the British Indian Army and the Indian Army during 18th, 19th and 20th Century. After the 1857,
the British applied the martial races theory and North Indian troops replaced the South Indians.
Post Independence, the PUNJAB Regiment of India was formed from the 2nd Punjab Regiment
of the British Indian Army. In 1951, four battle experienced Battalions of the former Princely
states of Punjab, joined the Regiment. These battalions were from the Jind and Nabha State
Forces and the first and second Battalions of Patiala Infantry. They were designated as the 13th,
14th, 15th and 16th battalions of the PUNJAB Regiment. Additional Battalions have been
raised since 1963. Since 1947, the PUNJAB Regiment has taken part in various battle sand
wars, winning numerous honours and awards for the same. The Regimental Centre of the
Regiment was first raised at Loralai and was shifted to Multan in 1922, Meerut in 1929 and at
last to its present location in Ramgarh, Jharkhand in 1976.1 During the Sino-India war of 1962,
the Regiment was deployed in the North-East Frontier Agency Sector (NEFA) as part of 7
Infantry Brigade of 4 Infantry Division and fought valiantly in the crucial battles in Namka
Chu Sector.
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after
its establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant
diplomatic status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state
recognition of PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into
negotiations with China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement
in 1954. Within a few weeks of Chou Enlai’s visit to India in 1954, the Chinese launched a
protest against the presence of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometers South of a Border
Pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the first time, the Government of China laid claim
to any part of Indian territory formally. The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957
marked a turning point in the Sino-India relations as the Chinese occupied a large part of the
Aksai Chin. This opened an opportunity for China to come out with territorial claims against
India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved in further into Ladakh and established

came on 10 October 1962. When groups of men from 2 RAJPUT were moving up the Southern
Bank of the Namkha Chu, making for Bridge III on their way to Log Bridge - the planned
crossing point on the way to Yutso La - a full Battalion of Chinese emerged from their positions
and moved quickly down the Ridge, to form up for an attack on, Tseng-Jong. At the same time
the Indian position at Tseng-Jong came under fire from heavy mortars. At around 0800 hours
approximately 800 Chinese attacked the 9 PUNJAB position at Tseng-Jong from the East and
North-East. After a heavy exchange of fire for about 45 minutes, the attack was repulsed.
However, the enemy soon re-formed for a second time and started assaulting the position at
around 0930 Hours. A Section of 9 PUNJAB under Havildar Malkiat Singh on Karpola II hadmoved close to the flank of the Chinese. The Section opened fire on the Chinese and completely
surprised them. While the Chinese were caught in the cross-fire of Light Machine Guns and
suffered heavy casualties, they reacted and opened Heavy Mortar fire on the Section. The
Section was subsequently asked to withdraw.

On 09 September 1962, India's then-Defence Minister Krishna Menon decided to evict the Chinese
troops stationed South of Thagla Ridge due to the increasing intensity of Chinese incursions into
Indian Territory. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's then Prime Minister, who was in London
for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, agreed with this decision. 7 Infantry Brigade
commanded by Brigadier JP Dalvi was then given the order to advance to Namka Chu, which was
considered as an advantageous ground for the Chinese. Being aware of this advantage, Chinese
attacked the Indian Post at Namka Chu on 20 October 1962 with overwhelming strength. The
Indian Army fought the assault but were soon overpowered by enemy’s strength in number and
superior weapons.

Government of India.On the eve of their attack on 19-20 October night, the Chinese had about four Battalions South of
the Thag La Ridge and two Companies in the vicinity of Khinzemane. They had also moved a
Battalion to Shao and nearly another Battalion to the subsidiary passes between Thag La and
Karpola II. The Chinese were also holding the rear positions between Thag La and Marmang In
depth. By 20 October, the Chinese had built up their strength to an estimated one Division in the
Thag La and Khinzemane areas. It was also reported that they had positioned an additional
Division in Bum La area. They had access to three routes (tracks) to reach Tawang. The rapid and
heavy build-up of the Chinese troops, armed with heavy mortars and Machine Guns and equipped
with modern entrenching tools, had forced the Indian Government to postpone the operation to
evict the Chinese from their illegal encroachment, North of the Namka Chu. It was felt that the
task would, for the time being, have to be limited to holding the Namka Chu.
After the Indian troops vacated Tawang on 23 October 1962, the Chinese occupied it. Chinese
stopped their push North of Tawang Chu. There was then a lull in fighting in Kameng Sector which
lasted a little over three weeks. The period of lull was utilised by the invaders in making
preparations for further thrust into Indian territory beyond Tawang. 4 GARHWAL RIFLES, which
covered the withdrawal the Tawang garrison across the Tawang Chu had suffered from confusion
and disorder on reaching South of the river. But they were halted, re-grouped together and the
situation was stabilised. They then occupied a Delaying Position at Jang where they battled with
the Chinese, inflicted casualties on the enemy and when the defence of the Bridge 4 over Tawang
Chhu became untenable they, as per plan, got it demolished on 24 October 1962.

be prepared to stay for the on-coming winter in its Delaying Position. The Garhwalis thus settled
down in the Nuranang area to perform their duties as Covering Troops for main defences of 62
Infantry Brigade Sector. They were to hold the area. During the period 24 October - 16 November
1962; 4 GARHWAL RIFLES carried out aggressive patrolling in this area. They harassed enemy
on the other side of the river by directing Howitzer shelling on their concentrations.
On the morning of 16 November at around 1000 hours; a patrol led by Jemadar Partap Singh
Rawat, Platoon Commander of ‘A’ Company which was occupying the forward most position in
the 4 GARWAL Defended Area, reported heavy enemy concentration in area Lhau across the
Tawang Chu. The Patrol also reported, at 1800 hours, that the enemy was constructing a bridge
over the river near the old Bridge 4 which was demolished earlier. At about 0500 hours on 17
November, Jemadar Gabar Singh Rawat, who was defending the right forward position of ‘A'
Company, was informed by his Observation Post that some men were advancing the road towards
the defences. At about the same time, noise of mine explosion was heard from the West flank of
the Company. It became clear that the Chinese were launching an attack. Jemadar Rawat and his
party lobbed a few grenades on the approaching enemy, and made their way back to the Company
under covering fire from the forward defended localities. The Chinese were now moving towards
the defences, and attacked in a series of waves for about 30 minutes under cover of mortar fire.
There attacks were beaten back with heavy casualties to the enemy. The enemy was then seen
withdrawing the rear, possibly to reorganise the situation.
On 17 November, the enemy launched fresh attack at about 0745 hours. This time, the attack was
preceded by heavy mortar and artillery fire. The Centre and Right flanks of the Garhwalis came
under heavy pressure. It was again mainly due to the hand grenades, that the enemy attack was
broken up. This assault lasted for about twenty minutes. Having failed, the enemy withdrew again,
leaving more casualties in front. The enemy having regrouped and reorganised, once again
launched assault on ‘A’ Company locality at 0910 hours. The Battalion successfully repulsed the
enemy attack again, inflicting heavy casualties. As the ‘A’ Company of the Battalion occupied the
forward-most location of the Battalion Defended Area, the enemy could not attack other
Company's locations without over-running 'A' Coy first. The Chinese once again formed up and
launched their most determined attack from three directions; front and both the flanks preceded by
very heavy shelling, at 1055 hours. The attackers came very close to the forward trenches of the
front Platoon. Naik Ranjeet Singh Gusain, seeing an imminent danger, came out of his bunker to
an open trench, and threw hand grenades very effectively on the assaulting enemy.The bunkers occupied by 4 Garhwal Rifles just north of Bridge 3 flanking the Nuranang Chu.
The place is now known as Jaswantgarh. In the background are the slopes on the Tawang side of
the Tawang/Mago Chu.

Subedar Udai Singh Rawat’s Platoon was holding the left rear flank of the Company defended
locality. At dawn, the Chinese attacked the forward Platoon locality with heavy mortar and small
arms fire. The attack was repulsed. At about 0800 hours, the enemy again attacked the Platoon
position with increased pressure from three directions. The attack was again repulsed and the
enemy suffered heavy casualties. At about 1100 hours the enemy brought a Medium Machine Gun
within 30 to 40 yards of the left flank of the Platoon locality and tried to neutralise the Section
Post and Light Machine Guns. They continued attacking in wave after wave. Subedar Udai Singh
Rawat found it necessary to destroy the enemy Medium Machine Gun with grenades. After
consulting his Company Commander, he tasked Lance Naik Trilok Singh Negi, VrC, Rifleman
Jaswant Singh Rawat, MVC and Riflemen Gopal Singh Gusain, VrC to destroy the enemy Medium
Machine Gun.
Subedar Rawat and his Company Commander personally engaged the enemy Medium Machine

present day Bhiwani district of Haryana. Soon after finishing his primary schooling, he joined
the 5th battalion of the JAT Regiment on 10 September 1937. During the 1962 Sino India war,
Subedar Nihal Singh was deployed in Galwan valley in Eastern Ladakh Sector. He was platoon
commander of No 2 platoon with headquarters at Galwan post near the forward section on the
left flank.
The JAT Regiment is one of the oldest regiments of the Indian Army. It is an infantry regiment
that claims its origins to the Calcutta Native Militia raised in 1795, which later became an
infantry battalion of the Bengal Army. Jats were historically considered to be a martial class
and were enlisted in the British Army as per the policy on class regiments. In 1922, the
grouping of the class regiment the 9 JAT was formed by bringing under a single regiment, four
active and one training battalion. In the post-independent era, the Jat regiment has lived up to
their reputation and holds the distinction of fighting in all the wars that India fought since its
independence including with the IPKF in Sri Lanka. Their battle cry: Jat Balwan, Jai Bhagwan
was adopted in 1955. During the 1962 Sino-India War, 5 JAT fought the Chinese with
indomitable spirit and bravery and were awarded theatre Honour “Ladakh 1962”.
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after
its establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant
diplomatic status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state
recognition of PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into
negotiations with China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement
in 1954. Within a few weeks of Chou Enlai’s visit to India in 1954, the Chinese launched a
protest against the presence of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometers south of a border
pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the first time, the Government of China laid claim
to any part of Indian territory formally. The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957
marked a turning point in the Sino-India relations as the Chinese occupied a large part of the
Aksai Chin. This opened an opportunity for China to come out with territorial claims against
India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved in further into Ladakh and established
themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal, just south of Dambu Guru. On 08
September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Post in the Eastern sector and
began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in the Eastern sector in Namka Chu
sector as well as in the Western sector in Ladakh. The overwhelming number of the Chinese
troops attacked the Indian soldiers but they fought the enemy with grit and determination. The
Chinese announced the cease-fire at midnight of 21/22 November 1962.1

The peculiar geography of Ladakh made it doubly difficult for the soldiers as the struggle was
not just with the enemy but also with the high-altitude terrain. In September 1962, Ladakh was
defended by 114 Brigade consisting of 5 JAT, 1/8 GORKHA RIFLES, 7 and 14 JAMMU &
KASHMIR MILITIA located at Leh. 14 J&K MILITIA with a company of 5 JAT was in Daulat
Beg Oldie (DBO) sector. The remaining elements of 5 JAT were in Changchenmo sector, 1/8
GORKHA RIFLES was in Chushul with 7 J&K MILITIA at the Indus Valley sector. In
October 1962, 5 JAT had a company strength at Galwan post, and rest of the Battalion at
Phobrang. Platoon sized posts were established at Hot Spring, Nala Junction, Patrol Base and
Tsogtsalu. 5 JAT took over the Galwan Post from 1/8 GORKHA RIFLES in the first week ofOctober. Ever since September, there was heavy snowfall in the area making the isolated troops
face great hardships. Often the supply drop meant for them fell into Chinese hands. On 20
October 1962, coinciding with their attack elsewhere in the sector the Chinese launched an
attack on Galwan post during the early hours. The JATS reported hearing Light Machine gun
(LMG) and 2 inch mortar firing from the direction of the post. After that, all communication
with the post also ceased. The attack on the post by Chinese started with heavy artillery and
mortar bombardment at 0530 Hr. After an hour of shelling the Chinese attacked the forward
section with almost a battalion strength. Indian soldiers who had moved to open trenches fought
a bitter last ditch battle. The capture of forward positions didn’t mean end of fighting, as the
Indian soldiers at the rear kept resisting enemies. It was only towards the evening that the
Chinese finally succeeded in overrunning the post. In all the Chinese launched three attacks. 2
During the attack, Subedar Nihal Singh was assigned to a rifle company, stationed at an altitude
of about 18,000 feet. When Chinese forces attacked the Company post on 20 October, 1962,
Subedar Nihal Singh, undaunted, faced the enemy and let the enemy come as near as 50 yards
and then ordered his platoon to engage the enemy. Chinese attacked with overwhelming force
and in waves and launched heavy artillery and mortar fire. In spite of heavy and frequent
shelling, Subedar Nihal Singh moved from post to post, encouraging mid rallying his men to
repulse the enemy. Under his inspiring leadership his men beat back several Chinese attacks in
spite of the Company suffering many casualties. Disregarding his own safety, he exposed
himself to enemy and a severe hand to hand fight followed with Chinese. He bayonetted five
Chinese soldiers single-handedly. During this short and intense fight, Subedar Nihal Singh
continued to encourage his men despite danger to himself until he was killed by a shell splinter.
Subedar Nihal singh showed exemplary leadership and personal gallantry against an enemy far
superior in number. He was awarded Vir Chakra posthumously for his bravery.

with great courage. Fought in the subzero temperatures and adversarial terrains of Eastern Ladakh,
the Battle of Rezang La stands out for the sheer tenacity and heroics of the Company of 13
KUMAON.
The KUMAON Regiment traces its origins to the 18th century and has fought in every major
campaign of the British Indian Army and the Indian Army including the two world wars. During
World War I, a Kumaon battalion was raised at Ranikhet on 23 October 1917 as 34/39th Kumaon
Rifles. In 1918, it was redesigned as 1st battalion, 50th Kumaon Rifles and a second battalion was
raised. These were merged with Hyderabad contingent into the 19th Hyderabad Regiment in 1923.
On 27 October 1945, the 19th Hyderabad was renamed as 19 Kumaon Regiment. Post-
Independence, it has been known as the Kumaon Regiment. Staying true to the regimental motto
of Parakramo Vijayate (Valour Triumphs) the regiment has proved its mettle in Indo-Pak War of
1947-48, Sino-India War of 1962, Indo-Pak War 1971, Kargil War of 1999 and also participated
in the Indian Peace-keeping Force in Sri Lanka. During the Sino-India War of 1962, 13 KUMAON

were better equipped and well trained to fight in inhospitable terrain. The attack in this sector
started on 18 November, coinciding with the attack on Sela in NEFA.
The Chinese launched a two-pronged attack on Chushul defences. The Northern prong attacked
Gurung Hill and the second prong of the Chinese troops attacked Charlie Company of 13

of Spangur Gap. Rezang La dominated the life line of the Chushul garrison- the road link with Leh
that went via Dungti.

around 0500 hours on 18 November 1962, C Company 13 KUMAON defending Rezang La
opened up with every weapon they had. After nearly half an hour of intense firing in the first round,
the Chinese took shelter behind boulders. At about 0540 hours the Chinese opened artillery and
mortar fire at the Indian troops. The telephone lines to the Battalion HQ got cut and the radio set
was destroyed. The fight at Rezang La was hard and bitter. Notwithstanding the disadvantages of
climate, terrain and weapons, Major Shaitan Singh and the C Company of 13 KUMAON went all
out to make sure their defensive position at Rezang La would make the enemy pay a heavy price.

The Army Medical Corps (AMC) in India boasts a legacy deeply rooted in the nation's military
history, evolving to meet the dynamic challenges of healthcare in the context of armed forces.
Established on 01 January 1764, the Bengal Presidency Medical Service, which was the first
military service of the three Presidencies in India. The Indian Army Medical Corps came into
existence as a homogeneous corps of officers and men on the pattern of the Royal Army Medical
Corps on 03 April 1943 by the amalgamation of the Indian Medical Service (IMS), the Indian
Medical Department (IMD) and the Indian Hospital & Nursing Corps. It was renamed as Army
Medical Corps after the Independence. The Corps was formed as a wartime necessity for attracting
suitably qualified men for service in a rapidly expanding army.1 The Army Medical Corps has
been a part of all combat and active operations that Indian Army was involved in. It has excelled
in providing both peace time and combat health care to the defence forces, medical services to UN
peace keeping forces in foreign missions and during disaster management to civil authorities.2 The
Corps has the motto of “Sarve Santu Niramaya” meaning “Let all be free from disease and
disability”.

KUMAON which was the Ahir Company at Rezang La, an isolated feature, about 11 km South of
Spangur Gap. Rezang La dominated the life line of the Chushul garrison- the road link with Leh
that went via Dungti.
The Chinese approached the Indian position through the nallahs that came up to the Hill Top. At
around 0500 hours on 18 November 1962, C Company 13 KUMAON commanded by Major
Shaitan Singh, defending Rezang La opened up with every weapon they had. After nearly half an
hour of intense firing in the first round, the Chinese took shelter behind boulders. At about 0540
hours the Chinese opened artillery and mortar fire at the Indian troops. The telephone lines to the
Battalion Head Quarters got cut and the radio set was destroyed. The fight at Rezang La was hard
and bitter. Notwithstanding the disadvantages of climate, terrain and weapons, Major Shaitan
Singh and the C Company of 13 KUMAON went all out to make sure their defensive position at
Rezang La would make the enemy pay a heavy price.

29659,Rifleman,Purna Bahadur Tamang,2 ASSAM RIFLES,"Rifleman Purna Bahadur Tamang was born on 01 July 1934, in Lamahatta Village of Lebong,
Darjeeling, West Bengal. His father’s name was M B Tamang. Rifleman Puma Bahadur
Tamang was enrolled into the 2 ASSAM RILES of the Indian Army on 19 January 1954.
During the Sino India War of 1962, Rifleman Tamang was posted in the NEFA Sector, where
he displayed commendable courage, great devotion to duty and saved the lives of forty soldiers.
The Assam Rifles, also called ""Sentinels of the North East"" came into being in 1835. With
approximately 750 men, this Force was formed to primarily protect British Tea estates and
their settlements against tribal raids. Subsequently, all these Forces were reorganised and
renamed as the ‘Frontier Force’ as their role was increased to conduct of punitive expeditions
across the borders of Assam. In 1870, these forces were merged into three Assam Military
Police Battalions, named as Lushai Hills, Lakhimpur and Naga Hills. The ‘Darrang’ Battalion
was raised just before the onset of World War–I. Since Reservists were difficult to be called
on short notice and Gurkha Battalions’ soldiers were on leave in Nepal, the Assam Military
Police were tasked to take their place. Thus, this Force sent over 3000 men as part of the British
Army to Europe and the Middle East. In 1917, recognising their work during the Great War,
fighting shoulder to shoulder with Rifle Regiments of the regular British Army, the name of
the Force was changed to ‘Assam Rifles’.1
Post-Independence, Assam Rifles participated in 1962 Sino-India War, Indian Peace Keeping
Force (IPKF) Sri Lanka in 1987 (OP PAWAN) to peacekeeping role in the North-Eastern
regions of India in the face of growing tribal unrest and insurgency. Assam Rifles has grown
substantially over the years from 17 battalions in 1960 to 46 battalions at present.

https://www.assamrifles.gov.in/english/newwindow.html?2030Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after
its establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant
diplomatic status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state
recognition of PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into
negotiations with China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement
in 1954. Within a few weeks of Chou Enlai’s visit to India in 1954, the Chinese launched a
protest against the presence of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometers South of a border
pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the first time, the Government of China laid claim
to any part of Indian territory formally. The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957
marked a turning point in the Sino-India relations as the Chinese occupied a large part of the
Aksai Chin. This opened an opportunity for China to come out with territorial claims against
India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved in further into Ladakh and established
themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal, just South of Dambu Guru. On 08
September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Post in the Eastern Sector and
began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in the Eastern Sector in Namka Chu
sector as well as in the Western sector in Ladakh. The overwhelming number of the Chinese
troops attacked the Indian soldiers but they fought the enemy with grit and determination. The
Chinese announced the cease-fire at midnight of 21/22 November 1962.2 During the war, the
NEFA was a hub of enemy invasions.

On 09 September 1962, India's then-Defence Minister Krishna Menon decided to evict the
Chinese troops stationed South of Thagla Ridge due to the increasing intensity of Chinese
incursions into Indian Territory. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's then Prime Minister,
who was in London for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, agreed with this
decision. The 7 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier JP Dalvi was then given the order
to advance to Namka Chu, which was considered as an advantageous ground for the Chinese.
Being aware of this advantage, Chinese attacked the Indian Post at Namka Chu on 20 October
1962 with overwhelming strength. The Indian Army fought the assault but were soon
overpowered by enemy’s strength in number and superior weapons.
On the eve of their attack on 19-20 October night, the Chinese had about four Battalions South
of the Thag La Ridge and two Companies in the vicinity of Khinzemane. They had also moved
a Battalion to Shao and nearly another Battalion to the subsidiary passes between Thag La and
Karpola II. The Chinese were also holding the rear positions between Thag La and Marmang
in depth. By 20 October, the Chinese had built up their strength to an estimated one Division
in the Thag La and Khinzemane areas. It was also reported that they had positioned an
additional Division in Bum La area. They had access to three routes (tracks) to reach Tawang.
The rapid and heavy build-up of the Chinese troops, armed with heavy mortars and MachineGuns and equipped with modern entrenching tools, had forced the Indian Government to
postpone the operation to evict the Chinese from their illegal encroachment, North of the
Namka Chu. It was felt that the task would, for the time being, have to be limited to holding
the Namka Chu. 7 Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier JP Dalvi, with its Headquarters
at Rongla was provided with four Infantry Battalions, less two Companies. They were 9
PUNJAB, 4 GRENADIERS, 2 RAJPUTS AND 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES along with some
Artillery.
The Chinese, who had been subjecting the Indian Post at Tsang Le on the North Bank of Namka
Chu, to heavy shelling since 17 October, but left this Post alone when at 0500 hours on 20
October, they engaged other Posts all along the Namkha Chu by heavy mortar fire. In the very
first few artillery barrages, telephone lines, linking the Brigade Headquarters with the units,
went dead, leaving the Units/Companies on their own and take any action they considered the
best. Brigade Headquarters was informed by the Dhola Post had been completely over run by
the Chinese.
The troops in Zimithang-Khinzemane area were directly under Tactical Headquarters 4
Infantry Division at Zimithang. When Major General Nirinjan Prasad the GOC visited
Khinzemane on 19 October afternoon, he appointed Lieutenant Colonel Rattan Singh, OC, 5
Assam Rifles, as the Sector Commander for this area. On 20 October at 0400 hours, when the
ASSAM RIFLES men were still in ""STAND TO"", the Chinese fired star shells over
Khinzemane and the whole area got illuminated. The men fought gallantly but could not stand
for long due to numerical superiority of the enemy. By the afternoon of 20 October, the Chinese
had driven back all the Indian troops from Bridges 1 to 5 along the Namka Chu, Tsangle (North
of Namka Chu across bride 5), Khinzemane (above the junction of Namka Chu with Nyamjang
Chu) and Tsangdhar.
On 22 October 1962, after a ridge in NEFA had fallen to the Chinese, it became difficult for a
Platoon Post to withdraw as the Chinese had occupied the neighbouring territory. No
instructions about the route they can take could be transmitted to the post as its wireless set had
gone out of order. In these adverse conditions, Rifleman Purna Bahadur Tamang volunteered
to carry a message from his Commanding Officer to the Commander of the Post. Running the
gauntlet of enemy fire, Rifleman Tamang made his way quickly through the jungles and
managed to deliver the message to the Platoon Commander in five hours’ time. This enabled.
the Platoon to extricate itself from the post and so saved the lives of the forty soldiers in it.
In this action, Rifleman Puma Bahadur Tamang displayed presence of mind and commendable
courage. He was awarded Vir Chakra for his great devotion to duty.

the Indian army on 01 February 1953. During the Sino India War of 1962, Havildar Ganga Bahadur
Rawat fought at Tsangdhar in North East Frontier Agency (NEFA) against the overwhelming
hordes of Chinese. He fought the enemy with great sense of duty and sacrificed himself for the
nation.
The first battalion of Gurkha Regiment (now GORKHA RIFLES) was raised in 1815 during the
Anglo-Nepalese war. Impressed by the qualities displayed by Gurkhas during the war, the British
started active recruitment of Gurkhas into the British Indian army. After the partition, in 1947 six
Gurkha regiments viz, 1 GR, 3 GR, 4 GR, 5 GR, 8 GR and 9 GR remained with the Indian Army,
while 2 GR, 6 GR, 7 GR and 10 GR were transferred to British Army as part of the Tripartite
Agreement signed between India, Nepal and Britain. The 9 GORKHA RIFLES was raised in 1817
at Infantry Levy at Fatehgarh as Fatehgarh Levy. In 1823, it became 63rd Regiment a regular unit
as part of the Bengal Native Infantry. Following the reorganisation after 1857, the designation was
changed to 9th Bengal Native Infantry with one of its companies formed by Gorkhas and other
hillmen. In 1893, the regiment became a wholly Gorkha unit before finally designated as 9th
GORKHA RIFLES in 1903. The Regiment fought in Europe during World War I and in Italy and
North West Frontier during World War II. Since independence, the regiment has proved its mettle
in Sino-India War of 1962 where it fought under the most demanding conditions on the Namka
Chu in NEFA (Now Arunachal Pradesh). Later, the Regiment was also involved in Indo-Pak War
of 1965 and 1971. The Regiment’s motto is ‘Kafar Hunu Bhanda Marnu Ramro’ (Better to die
than live like a coward).

partition of the subcontinent, his family settled in New Delhi. His father’s name was Mohkam
Chand Bali.1 Major Bali was Commissioned into 2 SIKH LIGHT INFANTRY Regiment of the
Indian Army on 14 December 1958 at the young age of 21. During 1965 Indo Pak War, he was
deployed in the Kutch area when Pakistan launched an attack on Sardar Post on 09 April 1965.
During the action, he displayed courage, organised the defences and captured four Pakistani
intruders while encouraging the State Reserve Police personnel stationed there to keep fighting the
enemy.
The SIKH LIGHT INFANTRY previously known as the Mazabhi and Ramdasia Sikh Regiment
is a Regiment of the Indian Army. Its name was changed to the Sikh Light Infantry in 1944. It is
the successor unit to the Mazabhi Sikh Pioneers 23rd, 32nd and 34th Sikh Pioneers. The SIKH
LIGHT INFANTRY inherited the battle honours, colours and traditions of the Mazabhi Sikh
Pioneers on its merging with a few Ramdasia companies in 1941. After serving under the British
Raj for nearly a century they distinguished themselves with loyalty to the British Crown and her
Empire in numerous conflicts in and around the Indian Subcontinent including both the First World
War and the Second World War. The SIKH LIGHT INFANTRY has displayed immense
versatility as the regiment conduct operations from Siachen Glacier to Counter-terrorism. The
regimental motto is ‘Deg Tegh Fateh’, meaning prosperity in peace and victory in war. Post
Independence, the regiment has participated in 1965 Indo Pak War, 1971 Indo Pak War and IPKP
operations. During the Indo-Pak War of 1971, 8 and 10 SIKH LI displayed exemplary courage and
fortitude, wherein 8 SIKH LI was awarded the Battle Honour “Fatehpur” for their heroic action2.
The Regiment has given the Indian Army three Chiefs- General Ved Prakash Malik PVSM, AVSM
who was the 19th Army Chief, General Bikram Singh PVSM, UYSM, AVSM, SM, VSM, who
was the 24th Army Chief and General Manoj Mukund Naravane PVSM, AVSM, SM, VSM, who
was the 28th Army Chief and retired on 30th April 2022.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and
Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our frontiers with Pakistan
have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing, incursions and
intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive measures. These
attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with commendable bravery and
steely resilience, but always with great restrain to not escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak War of

recovering from the damages of Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as an opportunity to
acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms of defence
preparation. The war initiated on 24 April 1965, when Pakistan Army, attacked our territory in the
Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This act of illegal
occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak Border Agreement 1960 and
international law as per the United Nations Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in
Kashmir with the launch of Operation Gibraltar.
Despite the build-up of tension during March, Pakistan claimed it was the creation of new Indian
Posts inside the Rann that led to the first outbreak of fighting. Major General Tikka Khan ordered
Brigadier Azhar on 06/07 April to carry out the removal and destruction of the Indian Post at
Sardar and other smaller Posts. The attack was supposed to be launched on 07/08 April but was
delayed owing to movements of Pakistani troops to the required positions, and so it commenced
at on 09 April. 18 PUNJAB was ordered to take Sardar Post and 6 BALUCH was to capture the
Indian Posts named Jungle and Shalimar.

and with covering fire from Medium Machine Guns, Heavy Mortars, 51 Infantry Brigade attacked
India's Sardar Post. The Shalimar Post was first to fall in the action but Sardar Post saw heavy
fighting during the night and through to the next afternoon. The attack did not lead to the swift
success that 51 Infantry Brigade had hoped for and despite mortar and artillery fire which became
heavier during the afternoon of 09 April, the Indian defenders succeeded, in holding their position.3
This Operation was code named “Desert Hawk’. The Sardar Post was garrisoned by a CRP
Battalion.

After facing the first Pakistani attack boldly, many CRP personnel defending Sardar Post withdrew
to two miles south to their Vigiokot Post. Having succeeded in driving the Indians from Sardar
post, the Pakistani forces did not realise it had been vacated and were already in the process of
their own withdrawal to their original positions. By the evening of 09 April, after a day of heavy
fighting, the Indian forces realised that Sardar Post was still unoccupied by Pakistan and then
reoccupied it without any fighting.4
In anticipation of a possible attack on the Vigokot Post, on 09 April, 'C' Company 17
RAJPUTANA RIFLES arrived at the Vigokot Post. Soon after, 2 SIKH LIGHT INFANTRY also
joined in. On 11 April, a Battery of 11 Field Regiment had also been deployed at Vigokot. On 11
April, a standing patrol (of a Company strength) of 2 SIKH LIGHT INFANTRY was sent to Sardar
Post. Simultaneously, 1 MAHAR commanded by Lieutenant Colonel (later General KS Sunderji)

was completed at Vigokot on 17 April and in Sardar Post area5.
After an unsuccessful attempt at Sadar Post, Pakistan inducted more troops in the area. Between
10-19 April, both sides engaged in patrolling and artillery exchanges. On 12 April, a Pakistani
patrol was engaged by the Indian artillery to the North of Sardar Post and suffered at least six
casualties. In another patrol clash on 15 April, some fleeing Pakistanis suffered casualties to the
South of Kanjarkot. It is significant that these activities were confined to the Vigokot-Sardar Post
area till 19 April.
Major Rajendra Kumar Bali of 2 SIKH LI was on a liaison visit to the State Reserve Police Post
in Vigokot in the Kutch area when Pakistani intruders launched an attack on Sardar Post in the
early hours of 09 April 1965. After the attack, wireless and telephone communication between
Sardar Post and Vigokot failed. Soon after, it was reported that Sardar Post had been overrun.
Major Bali helped to reorganise the defences in the Vigokot area and encouraged the State Reserve
Police personnel stationed there. After two Police patrols had failed to reach Sardar Post due to
shelling by the intruders, Major Bali volunteered to take out a patrol although he knew that the
Post might be in the hands of the intruders.
On reaching Sardar Post, he assisted in organising the defences. He arranged to collect the arms,
equipment and documents left behind by the intruders. Subsequently, with three Riflemen, he
captured four Pakistani intruders and a loaded Light Machine Gun. Again, on 15 June 1965,
disregarding his personal safety, Major Bali courageously went through his own minefields and
captured two intruders who had been trapped there.
Throughout the action, Major Rajendra Kumar Bali displayed cool courage and devotion to duty
in the best traditions of the Indian Army. He was awarded Vir Chakra for his gallantry.

Major Rajendra Kumar Bali was on a liaison visit to the State Reserve Police Post in Vigokot in
the Kutch area when Pakistani intruders launched an attack on Sardar Post in the early hours of 09
April 1965. After the attack, wireless and telephone communication between Sardar Post and
Vigokot failed. Soon after, it was reported that Sardar Post had been overrun. Major Bali helped
to reorganise the defences in the Vigokot area and encouraged the State Reserve Police personnel
stationed there. After two Police patrols had failed to reach Sardar Post due to shelling by the
intruders, Major Bali volunteered to take out a patrol although he knew that the Post might be in
the hands of the intruders. On reaching Sardar Post, he assisted in organising the defences. He
arranged to collect the arms, equipment and documents left behind by the intruders. Subsequently,
with three riflemen, he captured four Pakistani intruders and a loaded light machine gun. Again,
on 15th June 1965, disregarding his personal safety, Major Bali courageously went through his
own minefields and captured two intruders who had been trapped there.
Throughout, Major Rajendra Kumar Bali displayed cool courage, determination and devotion to
duty in the best traditions of the Indian Army.

4534259,Havildar,Gopinath Bhingardive,1 MAHAR,"Havildar Gopinath Bhingardive was born on 01 July 1936, in Bhingar, Ahmednagar in
Maharashtra. His father’s name was Ahilaji Bhingardive. He was enrolled in 1 MAHAR Regiment
of the Indian Army on 18 January 1957 at the young age of 20. During 1965 Indo Pak war, Havildar
Bhingardive was deployed at Sardar Post in the Kutch area and displayed conspicuous courage
and devotion to duty while saving a fellow comrade’s life amidst mortar and machine gun fire.
The MAHAR Regiment was initially intended to comprise of members from the Mahar
community. Today it is one of the most diverse Regiments in the Indian Army. In the 19th century,
they were recruited by the British East India Company and were part of the Company’s Bombay
Army. However, with the introduction of the ‘Class Regiments’ policy after the First War of
Independence in 1857, the British government demobilised the Mahar troops. When the First
World War broke out in 1914, the British government was forced to expand its recruiting policies
and a Mahar battalion was raised in 1917. After the war ended, the Battalion was disbanded again
in March 1921. In 1941, when Dr BR Ambedkar was appointed to the Viceroy’s Executive
Council, he exerted pressure on the British government to enlist the Mahar troops into the army.
In October 1941, 1 MAHAR was raised in Belgaum, thus establishing the origin of the present-
day Mahar Regiment. Between the two wars, the demand to raise Mahar Regiment was raised. The
Regiment’s war cry is “Bolo Hindustan Ki Jai”. The MAHAR Regiment has the distinction of
having two Army Chiefs General KV Krishnarao, COAS (01 June 1981 – 31 July 1983) and
General KS Sundarji, COAS (01 February 1986 – 31 May 1988) who belonged to this Regiment.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and
Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our frontiers with Pakistan
have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing, incursions and
intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive measures. These
attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with commendable bravery and
steely resilience, but always with great restrain to not escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak war of
1965 was the second war fought between these two bordering countries. While India was still
recovering from the damages of Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as an opportunity to
acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms of defence
preparation. The war initiated on 24 April 1965, when Pakistan Army, attacked our territory in the
Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This act of illegal
occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak Border Agreement 1960 and
international law as per the United Nations Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in
Kashmir with the launch of Operation Gibraltar.Despite the build-up of tension during March, Pakistan claimed it was the creation of new Indian
Posts inside the Rann that led to the first outbreak of fighting. Major General Tikka Khan ordered
Brigadier Azhar on 06/07 April to carry out the removal and destruction of the Indian Post at
Sardar and other smaller Posts. The attack was supposed to be launched on 07/08 April but was
delayed owing to movements of Pakistani troops to the required positions, and so it commenced
at on 09 April. 18 PUNJAB was ordered to take Sardar Post and 6 BALUCH was to capture the
Indian Posts named Jungle and Shalimar.
Pakistani troops advanced in the dark and achieved the desired surprise factor they had hoped for,
and with covering fire from Medium Machine Guns, Heavy Mortars, 51 Infantry Brigade attacked
India's Sardar Post. The Shalimar Post was first to fall in the action but Sardar Post saw heavy
fighting during the night and through to the next afternoon. The attack did not lead to the swift
success that 51 Infantry Brigade had hoped for and despite mortar and artillery fire which became
heavier during the afternoon of 09 April, the Indian defenders succeeded, in holding their position.1
This Operation was code named “Desert Hawk’. The Sardar Post was garrisoned by a CRP
Battalion.

After facing the first Pakistani attack boldly, many CRP personnel defending Sardar Post withdrew
to two miles south to their Vigiokot Post. Having succeeded in driving the Indians from Sardar
post, the Pakistani forces did not realise it had been vacated and were already in the process of
their own withdrawal to their original positions. By the evening of 09 April, after a day of heavy
fighting, the Indian forces realised that Sardar Post was still unoccupied by Pakistan and then
reoccupied it without any fighting.2

RAJPUTANA RIFLES arrived at the Vigokot post. Soon after, 2 SIKH LIGHT INFANTRY also
joined in. On 11 April, a Battery of 11 Field Regiment had also been deployed at Vigokot. On 11
April, a standing patrol (of a Company strength) of 2 SIKH LIGHT INFANTRY was sent to Sardar
Post. Simultaneously, 1 MAHAR commanded by Lieutenant Colonel (later General KS Sunderji)
stationed at Khavda was also ordered to move to Sardar on 12 April. The anti-tank mine laying
was completed at Vigokot on 17 April and in Sardar Post area3.
After an unsuccessful attempt at Sadar Post, Pakistan inducted more troops in the area. Between
10-19 April, both sides engaged in patrolling and artillery exchanges. On 12 April, a Pakistani
patrol was engaged by the Indian artillery to the North of Sardar Post and suffered at least six
casualties. In another patrol clash on 15 April, some fleeing Pakistanis suffered casualties to the
South of Kanjarkot. It is significant that these activities were confined to the Vigokot-Sardar Post
area till 19 April.
On 20 April, Pakistan again started shelling at Sardar Post. Havildar Gopinath Bhingardive of 1
MAHAR was a Mobile Fire Controller attached to the Company at Sardar Post. Despite constant
firing by Pakistani intruders, he continued to man the Observation Post throughout his stay at the
Sardar Post, disregarding his own safety.
At about 0100 hours, a Sepoy who had been badly wounded during patrol duty, while returning to
Sardar Post, staggered into our protective minefield and collapsed. The Battalion defended area
was at that time under enemy mortar and machine gun fire. Knowing full well about the dangers
of going through a minefield amidst Mortar and Machine Gun fire, Havildar Bhingardive fearlessly
went forward, lifted the unconscious Sepoy and brought him back to the Post. By his timely and
gallant action, he saved the life of his comrade.
Havildar Gopinath Bhingardive displayed great courage, comradeship and devotion to duty of a
high order. He was awarded Vir Chakra for his gallantry.

1942 in Multan, Pakistan. His father’s name was D S Khanna. Second Lieutenant Arjun Singh
Khanna was Commissioned into the Regiment of Artillery on 30 June 1963 at the young age of
21. During 1965 Indo Pak War, he was deployed in the Kutch area when Pakistan launched an
attack on Biar Bet post on 25-26 April 1965. During the action, he was part of 17 PARA FIELD
REGIMENT and displayed able leadership and conspicuous gallantry. He inflicted heavy
casualties on the enemy and stuck to his position till the he was ordered to withdraw. Later, he
commanded 16 Corps and also served as the Deputy Chief of the Army Staff (DCOAS) from 01
April 2001 to 31 August 2002.
The Regiment of Artillery was raised on 28 September 1827. It was initially raised as Bombay
Artillery and was later renamed 5 Bombay Mountain Battery. In May 1857, the mutiny by Indian
soldiers started in the artillery of the Army of the Bengal Presidency. The incident prompted a
complete ban on Indian artillery units, except the mountain artillery batteries in select provinces.
The decision was reversed in the mid-1930s when the first of the Field Regiments of the Indian
Army were raised. The Field Regiments support the formations on the field. The regimental motto
of Artillery Regiment ‘Sarvatra Izzat-O-Iqbal’ which means ‘Everywhere with Honour and Glory’.

On 24 April 1965, the Pakistan Army attacked the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles
inside the Indian territory. The Great Rann of Kutch is a salt marsh in the Thar Desert in Kutch
District of Gujarat, India. It is an 80 km wide and 515 km long stretch of land bordering on Sind
in Pakistan and Gujarat in India.
Source: http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/south_asia/2002/india_pakistan/timeline/1965.stmPakistani patrols began patrolling in territory controlled by India in January 1965, which was
followed by attacks on Indian posts. Initially involving border police from both nations, the
disputed area soon witnessed intermittent skirmishes between the armed forces of both countries.
Pakistan launched Operation Desert Hawk and captured few Indian post near the Kanjarkot Fort
border area. When India moved 50 PARA to check the Pakistani intrusion, Pakistan strengthened
its Brigade with a tank regiment. Successively, Pakistan again stuck on four border posts and
captured Vigokot and Biar Bet.
Despite the build-up of tension, Pakistan claimed it was the creation of new Indian Posts inside
the Rann that led to the first outbreak of fighting. After carrying out a reappraisal of the situation
in the Rann of Kutch, a major part of Major General Tikka Khan’s Division was concentrated in
Diplo area, regarded vital for both defence and offence. In order to destroy Indian forces in area
Chad Bet-Dharamsala-Vigokot-Karim Shahi and South of Diplo, he made a new plan. The PAF
was also alerted to strike the Indian concentrations. But on 23 April, General Tikka Khan received
an order to dislodge Indian post at Biar Bet at the earliest opportunity.

PP Singh. It was supported by a Troop of 17 Para Field Regiment and a Section each of MMG and
RCL. On 23 April, at 1800 hours, Major Singh sent a Reconnaissance Patrol under Second
Lieutenant Sharma to Jat Talai to ascertain the enemy strength. The Patrol did not return. That
night the noise of the movement of tracked and wheeled vehicles opposite the Company position
could be heard. There was shelling for about an hour from 0300 hours on 24 April. At 0600 hours,
Pakistanis, about a Battalion in strength, were seen advancing in assault formation, 100 meters
North-West of the position. When engaged by artillery, MMG and 3 Inch Mortars, the attackers
halted. But soon after at 0715 hours, Pakistani armour (Squadron plus) followed by APCs started
forming up about 1400 to 1800 meters in the North-North-West direction. They were engaged by
the artillery and RCL guns. Three of the Pakistani tanks appeared to have been knocked out. But
tank shells kept falling into the trenches and the temporary gun positions, ahead of the Company
locality.
Later, the Pakistani tanks, adopting fire-and-move tactics, advanced to within 700-800 meters of
the Company position. Realising the gravity of the situation, Major PP Singh ordered his troops to
withdraw under the covering fire of artillery, 3 Inch Mortars and RCL guns. In this encounter
Pakistanis suffered heavy casualties estimated to be 100 killed/wounded. 6 (Pakistan) PUNJAB
occupied Sera Bet by 0730 hrs, on 24 April 1965. This operation was code named Operation Desert
Hawk III and was executed by Brigadier Eftikhar Khan. During this attack 15 (Pakistan) PUNJAB
carried out a feint on Chhad Bet from Vingi to mislead the Indians. On 25 April, three Pakistani
tanks tried to probe South-West of Point 84, under cover of smoke-screen, but the attempt was
foiled.
After this, Pakistanis then turned their attention to Biar Bet, the other Indian Screen Position, about
13 km to the South-West of Point 84. On 25 April, at 1630 hours, a Pakistani patrol, mounted on
3 APCs, approached the 'A' Company's position at Biar Bet. The Company deployed there had in
support a sub-unit of 17 Para Field Regiment, and a Section each of 106 mm RCL guns, MMGs
and 3 Inch Mortars. Pakistani infantry in APCs, supported by twelve tanks made an unsuccessful
attempt to bypass the position at 1750 hours. Apprehending another Pakistan attempt, two
additional RCL guns and a Section of MMG were sent to Biar Bet on the night 25/26 April to
strengthen the position.
On 26 April, the Pakistanis subjected the Indian position to heavy shelling for an hour from 0500
hours. A smoke screen was also laid by them, at a distance of 700 meters from the Post, to hide
their movement. Thereafter, the infantry mounted on APCs and supported by tanks, launched a
major attack. The Indian guns went into action. But due to the dust raised by the Pakistani tanks
and the blast of RCL guns, the visibility was affected. In spite of this, the Indian guns set ablazethree Patton tanks and knocked out three others. But the Pakistani tanks, estimated at two
Squadrons, kept on advancing and shooting at the Indian position. Pakistanis also subjected a 3
PARA detachment stationed nearby at Arjun Tree to heavy shelling at 0720 hours, perhaps with a
view to prevent it from joining the Company at Biar Bet. At this stage, finding the enemy strength
unmanageable, the Indian troops began withdrawing from Biar Bet.
During the operations against Pakistani intruders in the Kutch area, Second Lieutenant Arjun Singh
Khanna was the Artillery Forward Observation Officer at Biar Bet. On 25 April 1965, when the
intruders 'attacked Biar Bet, supported by Artillery and tanks, Second Lieutenant Khanna engaged
the intruders with accurate fire and repulsed the attack. On the morning of 26 April 1965, when
Pakistan launched a fresh and determined attack with infantry, overwhelmingly superior in
numbers, and supported by Artillery and tanks, Second Lieutenant Khanna continued to direct
effective fire towards the intruders and this slowed down their advance, despite accurate shelling
and direct fire from enemy tanks. At one stage, when the overhead cover of his bunker was
demolished by a shell fired from a Tank, he shifted to a nearby trench and continued directing fire
until he was ordered to withdraw. In this action, be inflicted. heavy casualties on the intruders.
Under his able leadership his troops were able to withdraw without leaving a single man or any

day Pakistan. After the partition of the subcontinent, his family moved to India and settle in Delhi.
His father’s name was A N Kapoor. After matriculation, Major Somesh Kapur joined the Joint
Services Wing (JSW), (present day NDA)1 and was commissioned into 1 SIKH of the Indian Army
on 04 December 1954. During the 1965 Indo Pak War, he was deployed in Tithwal Sector in North
Kashmir. His task was to capture a Pakistani Post on Richhmar Ridge held by the enemy by a
Platoon Plus strength. It was in this action, he displayed conspicuous bravery and earned Vir
Chakra for his gallantry. Major Somesh Kapur subsequently commanded 18 SIKH and 124
Infantry Battalion (TA). After a glorious army career spanning more than three decades, Lieutenant
Colonel Somesh Kapur retired from the active service in the year 1985.2
The SIKH Regiment is one of the highest decorated regiments of the Indian Army. It came into
existence on 01 August 1846, with the raising of the Regiment of Ferozepore Sikhs and Regiment
of Ludhiana Sikhs by Captain G Tebbs and Lieutenant Colonel P Gordon respectively. They
participated effectively in the 1857 First War of Independence. This war revealed the valour and
fighting tenacity of the Sikh soldiers. They soon earned a rank of seniority over other Indian
Sepoys. Under the British Indian Army, the Sikh Regiment fought gallantly in a number of wars
and battles including the Battle of Saragarhi in which they left an indelible mark in the Regiment’s
history. By 1914 the Sikh Regiment was deployed as part of the British Indian Army for operations
in World War I. The Regiment served in all theatres of operations and earned 28 battle honours.
The modern Sikh Regiment traces its roots directly to the 11th Sikh Regiment of the British Indian
Army. When transferred to the Indian Army post-independence, the numeral 11 was removed and
new battalions were added. 1 SIKH was later mechanised in 1970 and re-designated as 4
MECHANISED INFANTRY on 02 April 1979.

penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian
territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak Border Agreement 1960 and international law as per the
United Nations Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of
Operation Gibraltar.
The infiltration of the Gibraltar Force at various points across the 750-km long Cease-fire Line
and the international border between Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir began on 05 August 1965.
It covered areas of Jammu, Punch and Uri in the West, Tithwal in the North-West, Guraiz in the
North and Kargil in the North-East. Initially, about 1,500 infiltrators crossed over in small batches,
and concentrated at selected points inside Kashmir to organise themselves into larger groups. They
were equipped with light automatic weapons and their aim, apart from sabotage, was to
indoctrinate the Kashmiris so that they could revolt against India.3 The period of the infiltration
campaign was characterised by intense, hectic activity throughout the J&K Theatre with special
emphasis in the Valley. The raiders and own forces marched and counter-marched all over the
inhospitable terrain in a vast grim game of hide and seek. Several times during the day the
opponents met, clashed and reeled apart in a series of bloody actions, weaving a confused pattern
hard to unravel.4
The second batch of infiltrators, comprising some 6000 men, was pushed into Jammu and Kashmir
in the third week of August. Taking into account the replacements for those who ""exfiltrated"", it
is estimated that on the whole, that about 8,000 infiltrators participated in these operations. By the
first week of September 1965, a third batch of infiltrators, approximately 5,500 strong, was ready
in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent across the border due to the
counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.5

Defence, Government of IndiaThe infiltrators initially worked in small groups independently. Subsequently, in the hope of better
results, they changed their tactics and started concentrating in selected areas in larger groups. Some
infiltrators exfiltrated without participating in any operation, while some others kept drifting till,
they ran into another group and merged with it. During the later phase of the operations, they were
able to establish strongholds in some areas, mostly isolated mountainous regions. Though the
Gibraltar Force succeeded in tying down a large number of the Indian security forces, it failed to
engineer an uprising in the State. The Force did succeed in committing some acts of sabotage and
violence, but it generally failed to achieve the objectives.
In the Tithwal Sector, the ‘Nusrat Force’, which operated in this area, did not function effectively
despite the fact that it was supported by regular Pakistani troops located near Mirpur. However,
from 13 to 18 August, the Pakistanis raided some Indian Posts and indulged in intensive firing. In
retaliation, the Indian troops crossed the Cease-fire Line on 24 August and occupied three Pakistani
Posts. It was during this action that a ""Divisional Order' signed by Maj Gen Akhtar Hussain Malik
was captured.Indian Army Deployment during Operation Gibraltar

The objective of the limited offensive launched by the Indian security forces in the Tithwal Sector
was to secure a series of tactically important features. On 23 August, at 2340 hours, a combined
patrol of 2 RAJPUT and 3/8 GORKHA RIFLES secured the Ring Contour area across the Cease-
fire Line. Although no opposition was encountered at the objective, the enemy shelled the position
throughout the night. The Rajputs and Gorkhas, however, held their ground. On 24 August, at 2130
hours, 1 SIKH less two Companies, supported by 138 Mountain Battery and 17 Field Battery,
attacked the Pakistani post on Richhmar Ridge, held in Platoon Plus strength. The attack was ably
led by Major Somesh Kapoor, and the enemy, taken by surprise, fled in confusion. The assaulting
Companies pressed on to the PT Ground, occupied by a Company (less Platoon) of 16 AzadKashmir (POK) Battalion and elements of 5 (Pakistan) PUNJAB. By 2250 hours, Richhmar Ridge
was in the hands of Indian troops. In this action, a large quantity of arms, ammunition and rations
was captured. Some of these weapons were later used by the SIKHs in subsequent operations.
On 22 August 1965, Major Somesh Kapoor, Company Commander of 1 SIKH was ordered to
capture two Pakistani Posts in the Poonch Sector by 24 August 1965. Since no suitable routes for
outflanking the enemy could be found, it was decided to launch a frontal attack with three Platoons.
On 24 August 1965, as soon as the leading Platoon had entered the first enemy Post, Major Kapoor
decided that he must attack the next Post immediately. With two scouts ahead, Major Kapoor led
his Company past the first Post. When he was at a distance of about 50 yards from the objective,
the enemy opened fire with Medium and Light Machine Guns. Major Kapoor having issued
necessary orders to two of his Platoons, moved forward with the third Platoon through the enemy’s
forward position and assaulted the depth locality. The speed and momentum of the assault was so
great that it broke the enemy's resistance and the Post was captured in 30 minutes. Eight enemy
soldiers were killed, six were taken prisoner and large quantity of arms and ammunition was
captured.
Throughout this operation, Major Somesh Kapoor displayed leadership and devotion to duty of
high order. He was awarded Vir Chakra for his gallantry.","Major Somesh Kapoor (IC-7015), 1 SIKH

Sujanpur Tira Village of Hamirpur District in Himachal Pradesh. His father’s name was Shri Lalo
Ram. Lieutenant Bhikham Singh was commissioned into 7 PUNJAB of the Indian Army on 30
June 1963 from the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun. During the 1965 Indo Pak War, he was
Commanding a Company in the Lahore Sector where he fought gallantly, performed his duties
with great speed and skill and got a new defensive position ready during the night despite the
enemy shelling.
The PUNJAB Regiment, among the oldest in the Indian Army, traces its origins back to 1805 when
the First Battalion was raised under the Maharaja of Patiala. Originally, the Regiment comprised
four British-raised Battalions. The numbers and titles of the Battalions changed during the
successive reorganisations of the Madras Presidency Army, the British Indian Army and the Indian
Army during 18th, 19th and 20th Century. After the 1857, the British applied the martial races theory
and North Indian troops replaced the South Indians. Post Independence, the PUNJAB Regiment
of India was formed from the 2nd Punjab Regiment of the British Indian Army. In 1951, four battle
experienced Battalions of the former Princely states of Punjab, joined the Regiment. These
battalions were from the Jind and Nabha State Forces and the first and second Battalions of Patiala
Infantry. They were designated as the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th battalions of the PUNJAB
Regiment. Additional Battalions have been raised since 1963. Since 1947, the PUNJAB Regiment
has taken part in wars, including 1962 Sino India War, 1965 and 1971 Indo Pak War, various battle
sand wars, winning numerous honours and awards for the same. The Regimental Centre of the
Regiment was first raised at Loralai and was shifted to Multan in 1922, Meerut in 1929 and at last
to its present location in Ramgarh, Jharkhand in 1976.1
The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and Indian frontiers with Pakistan have remained a
sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at
several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of
Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with commendable bravery and steely
resilience, but always with great restrain to not escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak War of 1965
was the second war fought between these two bordering countries. While India was still recovering
from the damages of Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu
and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms of defence preparation. The war
initiated on 24 April 1965, when Pakistan Army, attacked our territory in the Rann of Kutch and
penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian
territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak Border Agreement 1960 and international law as per the
1 Ballabh, Anand, Insights into Infantry Regiments: A Basic Factbook. Forward Books publications. New Delhi (2013)United Nations Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of
Operation Gibraltar.
The infiltration of the Gibraltar Force at various points across the 750-km long Cease-fire Line
and the International Border between Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir began on 05 August 1965.
It covered areas of Jammu, Punch and Uri in the West, Tithwal in the North-West, Guraiz in the
North and Kargil in the North-East. Initially, about 1,500 infiltrators crossed over in small batches,
and concentrated at selected points inside Kashmir to organise themselves into larger groups. They
were equipped with light automatic weapons and their aim, apart from sabotage, was to
indoctrinate the Kashmiris so that they could revolt against India.2 The period of the infiltration
campaign was characterised by intense, hectic activity throughout the J&K Theatre with special
emphasis in the Valley. The raiders and own forces marched and counter-marched all over the
inhospitable terrain in a vast grim game of hide and seek. Several times during the day the
opponents met, clashed and reeled apart in a series of bloody actions, weaving a confused pattern
hard to unravel.3
The second batch of infiltrators, comprising some 6000 men, was pushed into Jammu and Kashmir
in the third week of August. Taking into account the replacements for those who ""exfiltrated"", it
is estimated that on the whole, about 8,000 infiltrators participated in these operations. By the first
week of September 1965, a third batch of infiltrators, approximately 5,500 strong, was ready in
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent across the border due to the
counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.4 The plan failed with their early detection and lack
of support from the locals, who gave away their positions.
In sheer desperation, Pakistan also employed its artillery in support of guerrilla operations in the
Chhamb area. India grasped the criticality of the ongoing plan, repulsed the attacks and cut off the
entry and exit points into the Kashmir Valley. A quick and firm response by India took Pakistan
by surprise and thwarted their well laid out plans. India reacted almost immediately by recapturing
Kargil heights which had been returned in Jul 1965, a limited offensive in the Tithwal Sector and
most importantly, the capture of Haji Pir Pass in a daring operation by 1 PARA by Major (later
Lieutenant General) Ranjit Singh Dayal under 68 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier (later
Lieutenant General) ZC Bakshi on 28 August 1965. This was one of the most notable
achievements of the riposte. The capture of Haji Pir and loss of key positions in the Kishenganga
Bulge were a severe setback for the Pakistanis which put them in a state of shock. Thus, by the

The failure of Operation Gibraltar saw the last Phase, Operation Grand Slam put into effect by
General Ayub Khan on 01 September 1965. Pakistan did not call off Operation ‘Grand Slam'
despite the security council's call for an immediate cease-fire on 4 September 1965. It even carried
out an air raid on Amritsar the next day. The Indian warning that an attack against Jammu and
Kashmir would be treated as an attack against India was also ignored by Pakistan. Meanwhile,
apprehending a Pakistani attack, India had also formulated a contingency plan to meet the situation
militarily. The Indian plan visualised a limited offensive intended to cover the area from Dera
Baba Nanak in the North to the Sutlej in the South.Punjab Theatre: 1965 Indo Pak War

The objective of the retaliatory Indian plan was to threaten Lahore, drive a wedge between the
Pakistani forces deployed in the Lahore and Sialkot sectors and destroy their war potential. The
offensive was to serve the dual purpose of ensuring the security of Punjab by advancing the Indian
defence line to the Ichhogil Canal and to capture some Pakistani territory to serve as a bargaining
lever in the political parleys, on the conclusion of hostilities.
In view of the above plan, XI Corps under Lieutenant General JS Dhillon was assigned the tasks
on August 1965 to destroy the enemy forces which might enter Punjab and Ganganagar Sector in
Rajasthan. Also, on orders from Lieutenant General Harbaksh Singh, GOC-in-C Western
Command, the Corps was to undertake the following measures simultaneously:a. To advance to the Ichhogil Canal along the axes GT road, Bhikkiwind-Khalra and
Bhikkiwind-Khem Karan, to secure Pakistani territory from opposite Ranian inclusive to
its junction with Dipalpur Canal opposite Hussainiwala. Also to capture intact Ichhogil
Uttar road bridge, GT road bridge, Jallo road bridge and Barki Bridge on Ichhogil Canal
b. To eliminate the Pakistani bridge-head at the Dera Baba Nanak and if possible, capture the
bridge on the Ravi River, intact.
The initial task of XI Corps was to secure the East bank of the Ichhogil Canal and establish
bridgeheads across the Canal at some points. Surprise was achieved and the three Indian Divisions
gained notable success. In the South, 4 Mountain Division, under Maj Gen Gurbakhsh Singh,
launched an attack on the Khem Karan-Kasur axis and succeeded in capturing all its objectives,
either wholly or partially, by 1230 hours on 06 September. Further North, 7 Infantry Division,
under Maj Gen H K Sibal, captured Hudiara by 1030 hours. 15 Infantry Division under Maj Gen
Niranjan Prasad achieved some early success. One of its Battalions, 3 JAT crossed the Ichhogil
Canal at Dograi and reached Batapore on the outskirts of Lahore. Another Battalion of the Division
advanced up to the road bridge over this Canal near Bhaini Dhilwal, 9 km North of Dograi. The
bridge over the Ravi River at Dera Baba Nanak was captured by 29 Infantry Brigade. These
attacks, launched with speed and vigour, jolted Pakistan.

Ichhogil Canal from the Canal-Ravi River junction. (inclusive) in the North to the Canal-track
crossing (4 km south of Jallo) in the South (inclusive). In carrying out the task, priority was to be
given to the capture and holding of Bridges over the Ichhogil Canal on GT Road, the Ichhogil
Uttar (Bridge near Bhaini Dhilwal) and Jallo. Boundary between 15 Infantry Division and 7
Infantry Division was to be the Canal Track Junction - Manihala _ Rajatal- Dhand - Bundala (all-
inclusive to 15 Infantry Division).
15 Infantry Division was alerted about 'Operation Riddle' on 01 September, and on 03 September
was issued detailed instructions for the conduct of the operation in two phases:
Phase I
(a) Advance up to the Ichhogil Canal and capture of the GT road Bridge and the Jallo link road
bridge over Ichhogil Canal by 54 Infantry Brigade.
(b) Advance up to the Ichhogil Canal and capture the road bridge at Bhaini Dhilwal by 1 JAT
Group.
Phase II
(a) Capture of Dogaich - Bhasin by 38 Infantry Brigade and securing of the east bank of the
Ichhogil Canal.5
The troops allotted to 15 Infantry Division under Major General Niranjan Prasad, for undertaking
these tasks included 38 Infantry Brigade, 54 Infantry Brigade, 15 Artillery Brigade less 5 Field
Regiment, plus 60 Heavy Regiment and one Medium Battery (with effect from 8 September), 14
HORSE less Squadron, and 96 Infantry Brigade (taken out as Corps reserve). 96 Brigade was to
be deployed astride the GT Road at the Hudiara drain to cover Amritsar.
Major General Niranjan Prasad made out the following operational plan within the parameters laid
down by senior Commanders:
(a) 1 JAT (From 38 Infantry Brigade), with one troop of Sherman tanks of SCINDE
HORSE under command, was to capture the Bhaini- Dhilwal Bridge.
5 The Indian-Pakistan War of 1965: A History. S.N. Prasad. U.P. Thapliyal (2011). Natraj Publishers and Ministry
of Defence, Government of India(b) 54 Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brig MS Rikh, was to advance on the GT
road axis, clear Gosal Dial and establish a firm base. Next it was to capture the main road
and rail bridges over the Ichhogil Canal.
(c) 38 Brigade less 1 JAT, commanded by Brig PW Pathak, was to act as a reserve for 54
Brigade operations under the immediate Division control.
After Phase I, 38 Infantry Brigade was ordered to carry out Phase II of the operation on the night
of 06/07 September. It involved capturing of Dograich-Bhasin and securing of the east bank of
Ichhogil. But in view of the changed scenario on the battle front, the task allotted to the Brigade
was slightly modified. It was now ordered to secure the East bank of Ichhogil Canal in the general
area of the aqueduct. The Brigade moved after last light on 06 September, on man-pack basis, via
Wagah-Singhpura, but could not make much progress. After covering some distance it firmed in
at Sadhanwali, well short of the Canal. Meanwhile. in view of the dismal performance of 15
Infantry Division, and also due to differences between GOC Niranjan Prasad and his senior
Commander, the former was replaced by Major Gen Mohinder Singh, MC, on the night of 07/08
September.

During 08, 09 and 10 September, Pakistan maintained pressure on Indian positions by conducting
raids, artillery shelling and armour attacks. But, except on the Ranian axis, the Indians remainedfirm and inflicted heavy losses on the attackers. On 10 September, in the face of the increasing
pressure, the remnants of 1 JAT and 6 KUMAON withdrew to Lopoke and Ranian and Kakkar
fell into Pakistani hands. The same day, 96 Infantry Brigade was relieved by 50 Para Brigade and
placed under the command of 15 Infantry Division for securing the right flank of the Division
sector and for preventing any ingress of the Pakistani armour from the Syphon area. Thereafter, it
was moved to the Kohali area to restore the situation on that axis and was also asked to stand ready
to advance on to the Ichhogil bridge at Bhaini Dhilwal at short notice.
In the changed scenario, 15 Infantry Division ordered Brig V N Malhotra, Commander 96
Infantry Brigade, to undertake the following tasks:
a) Occupy battalion defended areas astride Lopoke-Chuganwan Amritsar road, based on the
UDBC Lahore Branch at Kohali.
b) Deny use of Kakkar-Lopoke-Kohali-Amritsar Road to Pakistani troops.
c) Capture Ichhogil Hithar-Ichhogil Uttar area by first light on 11 September.
d) Destroy the remaining Pakistani pockets in the Indian territory, East and North-east of
Ichhogil Hithar.
The Brigade Commander planned the deployment of his battalions for ""OPERATION SLASH' as
follows: In the first phase, 16 DOGRA completed the allotted task by 0445 hours on 11 September,
unopposed. In the second phase, 6 KUMAON was to advance on the Lopoke-Kakkar. Ranian axis
and firm in along the Ranian bund by first light on 12 September.7 PUNJAB was to provide the
Battalion a firm base for operations at Lopoke, while 16 DOGRA was to eliminate the Pakistani
opposition at Thata Dhilwan by the first light on 12 September. 6 KUMAON secured Kakkar at
2145 hours on 11 September and Ranian at 0245 hours on 12 September, while 16 DOGRA
secured Chak Allah Baksh at 2200 hours on 11 September and the Visvian area at 1000 hours on
12 September. Phase 2 of 'OPERATION SLASH' was thus completed.
In the third Phase, 7 PUNJAB was to capture the Bhaini-Dhilwal Bridge intact and establish a
Bridgehead across the Ichhogil Canal. In the event that the bridge was found blown, the Battalion
was to hold out the East bank of the Canal. 7 PUNJAB captured the east bank of Ichhogil and the
Bhaini-Dhilwal bridge by the last light on 14 September, despite heavy shelling and bitter
opposition. An armour threat to Amritsar via the Chuganwan approach was thus eliminated.Indian troops at Dograi village on the Ichhogil Canal, Lahore with Pakistani ammunition and

able to establish strongholds in some areas, mostly isolated mountainous regions. Though the
Gibraltar Force succeeded in tying down a large number of the Indian security forces, it failed to
engineer an uprising in the State. The Force did succeed in committing some acts of sabotage and
violence, but it generally failed to achieve the objectives.
In the Tithwal Sector, the ‘Nusrat Force’, which operated in this area, did not function effectively
despite the fact that it was supported by regular Pakistani troops located near Mirpur. However,
from 13 to 18 August, the Pakistanis raided some Indian Posts and carried out intensive firing. In
retaliation, the Indian troops crossed the Cease-fire Line on 24 August and occupied three Pakistani
Posts. It was during this action that a ""Divisional Order' signed by Maj Gen Akhtar Hussain Malik
was captured.

was to secure a series of tactically important features. On 23 August, at 2340 hours, a combined
patrol of 2 RAJPUT and 3/8 GORKHA RIFLES secured the Ring Contour area across the Cease-
fire Line. Although no opposition was encountered at the objective, the enemy shelled the position
throughout the night. The Rajputs and Gorkhas, however, held their ground. On 24 August, at 2130
hours, 1 SIKH less two Companies, supported by 138 Mountain Battery and 17 Field Battery,
attacked the Pakistani Post on Richhmar Ridge, held in Platoon Plus strength. The attack was ably
led by Major Somesh Kapoor, and the enemy, taken by surprise, fled in confusion. The assaulting
Companies pressed on to the PT Ground, occupied by a Company (less Platoon) of 16 Azad
Kashmir (POK) Battalion and elements of 5 (Pakistan) PUNJAB. By 2250 hours, Richhmar Ridge
was in the hands of Indian troops. In this action, a large quantity of arms, ammunition and rations
was captured. Some of these weapons were later used by the SIKHs in subsequent operations.
Major Somesh Kapoor was awarded the Vir Chakra in this action for his exemplary leadership.
The Sikhs, next attacked the formidable Pir Sahiba feature on the night of 25/26 August with 138
Mountain Battery in support. The feature was held by the Pakistanis in company strength. Indian
troops stealthily crept up the treacherous slopes of the mountain, and when within the assaulting
distance, made a bold dash for the post. The defenders fought bravely but could not stand up to the
Sikhs. Indians maintained a vigil in the area, and kept a watch on important routes, which the
Pakistani saboteurs had been using to enter Kashmir. In the first week of September, they improved
their position by moving slightly northwards and capturing some mountain heights.4
On 24 August, 1965, a Company of 1 SIKH was ordered to capture an important objective in the
Tithwal Sector in Jammu & Kashmir, for which it was necessary to clear a Pakistani Post. When
the forward Platoon closed in on the enemy Post and severe hand-to-hand fighting developed,
Lance Havildar Gurdev Singh was ordered to strengthen the assault with his Section. While
charging the enemy, Lance Havildar Singh was severely wounded in the left arm by a splinter. In
spite of his injury, he pressed forward the attack using his bayonet and shooting at the enemy with
one hand. Thereafter, on the commencement of the main attack on the objective, he refused to be
evacuated and improvised a sling for his wounded arm and joined the main attack. By firing a sten
gun with his right hand and throwing grenades with his wounded left arm, he cleared three enemy
bunkers almost single-handed. Subsequently, deploying his Section-on the captured position, he
joined the reserve platoon which was then attacking the depth localities of the enemy and bravely
moved from bunker to bunker. He refused to be evacuated till the entire Company reorganisation
was complete.

The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and Indian frontiers with Pakistan have remained a
sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at
several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of
Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with commendable bravery and steely
resilience, but always with great restrain to not escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak War of 1965
was the second war fought between these two bordering countries. While India was still recoveringfrom the damages of Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu
and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms of defence preparation. The war
initiated on 24 April 1965, when Pakistan Army, attacked our territory in the Rann of Kutch and
penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian
territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak Border Agreement 1960 and international law as per the
United Nations Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of
Operation Gibraltar.

The infiltration of the Gibraltar Force at various points across the 750-km long Cease-fire Line
and the International Border between Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir began on 05 August 1965.
It covered areas of Jammu, Punch and Uri in the west, Tithwal in the North-West, Guraiz in the
North and Kargil in the North-East. Initially, about 1,500 infiltrators crossed over in small batches,and concentrated at selected points inside Kashmir to organise themselves into larger groups. They
were equipped with light automatic weapons and their aim, apart from sabotage, was to
indoctrinate the Kashmiris so that they could revolt against India.1 The period of the infiltration
campaign was characterised by intense, hectic activity throughout the J&K Theatre with special
emphasis in the Valley. The raiders and own forces marched and counter-marched all over the
inhospitable terrain in a vast grim game of hide and seek. Several times during the day the
opponents met, clashed and reeled apart in a series of bloody actions, weaving a confused pattern
hard to unravel.2
The second batch of infiltrators, comprising some 6000 men, was pushed into Jammu and Kashmir
in the third week of August. Taking into account the replacements for those who ""exfiltrated"", it
is estimated that on the whole, about 8,000 infiltrators participated in these operations. By the first
week of September 1965, a third batch of infiltrators, approximately 5,500 strong, was ready in
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent across the border due to the
counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.3 The plan failed with their early detection and lack
of support from the locals, who gave away their positions.
In sheer desperation, Pakistan also employed its artillery in support of guerrilla operations in the
Chhamb area. India grasped the criticality of the ongoing plan, repulsed the attacks and cut off the
entry and exit points into the Kashmir Valley. A quick and firm response by India took Pakistan
by surprise and thwarted their well laid out plans. India reacted almost immediately by recapturing
Kargil heights which had been returned in Jul 1965, a limited offensive in the Tithwal Sector and
most importantly, the capture of Haji Pir Pass in a daring operation by 1 PARA by Major (later
Lieutenant General) Ranjit Singh Dayal under 68 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier (later
Lieutenant General) ZC Bakshi on 28 August 1965. This was one of the most notable
achievements of the riposte. The capture of Haji Pir and loss of key positions in the Kishenganga
Bulge were a severe setback for the Pakistanis which put them in a state of shock. Thus, by the
end of August 1965, Pakistan’s plans for quick annexation of the Valley had been squarely
defeated.
The failure of Operation Gibraltar saw the last Phase, Operation Grand Slam put into effect by
General Ayub Khan on 01 September 1965. A massive attack was planned in the Chhamb-Jaurian
Sector aimed at capturing Akhnur, which would sever communications and cut off supply routes
to Indian troops. In desperation, Pakistan played its hand by launching Operation ‘Grand Slam’ on

at Akhnur; thus, Pakistan aimed at cutting of Indian positions in Naushera, Rajauri and Punch.
Thereafter, as a part of Operation Grand Slam, an armoured thrust could be developed towards
Jammu, the capture of which would have severed all land communications to Jammu & Kashmir.4
This would place Pakistan in a position to dictate terms to India.

While 68 Infantry Brigade was carrying out its grim battle for the capture of the Hajipir Pass, 93
Infantry Brigade had, after an initial setback, been pushing Northwards to establish a link up for
lopping off the Bulge. Between Punch and Kahuta, there were many hill features which dominated
the Punch-Haji Pir track. The enemy picquets located on these features had cement emplacements
for MMGs and shellproof bunkers. All approaches to the picquets were covered by MMGs, guns
and mortars. 93 Infantry Brigade launched OPERATION FAULAD to achieve the Punch-Haji Pir
link-up by capturing these picquets. The main features of ‘OPERATION FAULAD', where the
gallant actions were fought are the capture of the Raja and Chand Tekri picquets, both of which

Company), with 2x3.7-inch Howitzers and 2x81 mm Mortars in support. The men, equipped with
automatic weapons were entrenched in shell-proof shelters and the picquets were protected with
barbed wires and mines. In short, both picquets were turned into miniature fortresses.
On the night of 05/06 September 1965, a simultaneous attack was launched on Raja and Chand
Tekri picquets by 2 SIKH and 3 DOGRA respectively. The attack was preceded by intense artillery
shelling, but it had little impact on the built-up positions. As the approach to the objectives lay
along steep and slippery slopes, the assaulting troops had to crawl on all fours rather than walk.
When they neared the picquets, heavy automatic fire greeted them. The Indian wavered
momentarily, but inspired by bold leadership, they recovered quickly and dashed through the
mines and wires. A grim hand-to-hand battle raged for over two hours before the picquets fell.5
The garrison at Raja picquet fought to the last man. The Indian side also suffered heavy casualties.
During the assault on Raja Picquet on 06 September, Lieutenant Colonel NN Khanna,
Commanding Officer 2 SIKH, led his men braving the devastating fire of the enemy. Lieutenant
Colonel Khanna was decorated with the Mahavir Chakra for his exceptional courage and
leadership, posthumously.

on Raja picquet. At about 0600 hours on 06 September 1965, when the Companies were at distance
of about 50 yards from the objective. Their progress was halted by intense enemy fire. Although
in the direct line of fire, Naik Chand Singh rushed forward to the enemy Machine Gun Post, threw
grenades into the bunkers and killed the gunners. This gallant action of Naik Singh made the
assault success and the Raja picquet was captured without many casualties on our side.
With the fall of Raja and Chand Tekri, the back of Gibraltar Force was broken in this Sector.
Thereafter, Indian troops faced little difficulty in mopping up and liquidating the remaining
pockets of resistance in the area. The link-up was completed with the capture of Kahuta on 10
September 1965 and with that the Indian security forces closed the mouth of the bulge and sealed
the Haji Pir sector. Consequently, the enemy resistance east of the Betar Nallah also ceased.
Throughout the attack, Naik Chand Singh displayed courage, leadership and determination of a
high order. He was awarded Vir Chakra.","3341107 Naik Chand Singh (IC-12453), 2 SIKH

Pradesh. He was commissioned into the DOGRA Regiment on 23 November 1955. Naik Prem
Singh was awarded the #VirChakra on 06 September 1965.
The DOGRA Regiment, raised in 1877 is one of the older infantry regiments of the Indian
Army. The regiment traces its roots directly from the 17th Dogra Regiment of the British Indian
Army. After World War I, the British Indian government restructured the army, moving from
Regiments with a single Battalion to multi -Battalion Regiments. In 1945, it shed the numeral
‘17’ and became Dogra Regiment. The DOGRA Regiment has troops from Himachal Pradesh,
Jammu and Kashmir, and the Northern Districts of Punjab. Their Regimental war cry is “Jwala
Mata Ki Jai” (Victory to Goddess Jwala). The Dogras have participated in all the wars and
conflicts fought by the Indian Army since independence and winning laurels. General NC Vij,
PVSM, UYSM, AVSM who was the 21st Chief of the Army also belonged to the DOGRA
Regiment.
The genesis of the Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of
contention between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state
of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our
frontiers with Pakistan have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off
resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India
to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed

the Indo-Pak Border Agreement ,1960 and the international law as per the United Nations
Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation
Gibraltar.
In 1965, 93 Infantry Brigade under Brigadier Zora Singh launched Operation Faulad to capture
the picquets, located on the hill features that lay between Punch and Kahuta. The enemy
picquets were swamped with MMGs and shellproof bunkers, and the approaches to these
picquets were shielded with MMGs, guns and mortars.
The Poonch - Haji Pir Road was under the control of two enemy posts, known as Raja and
Rani. Raja Post was situated 1.5 kilometers to the North of our own Post, which was designated
as 405. The gap between the front lines was merely one kilometer. Rani Post was an additional
kilometer to the North West of Raja. Capturing these two Posts was essential for securing the
Poonch - Uri connection. After the capture of Haji Pir the entire focus was on capturing these
two Posts. The plan was for Brigadier Zora Singh to advance along a series of dominating
features that included Raja and Rani and link up with Brigadier ZC Bakshi’s 68 Mountain
Brigade on the Poonch _ Kahuta-Haji Pir – Uri axis.The picquets were defended by a Battalion (less a Company), with two 3.7-inch Howitzer and
two 81 mm Mortars in support. The soldiers, armed with automatic weapons, were positioned
in well-fortified shelters that could withstand artillery shelling. Furthermore, the outposts were
fortified with barbed wire and mines. In short, both picquets were turned into miniature
fortresses.
During the night of 05/06 September 1965, a simultaneous attack was launched on Raja and
Rani picquets by 2 SIKH and 3 DOGRA respectively. 3 RAJ RIF was in reserve and tha attack
was supported by 42 Field Regiment and 3.7 mm Pack Howitzers of 75(Patiala) Mountain
Battery. 3 DOGRA was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel RB Nair. Naik Prem Singh was
leading Section Commander of B Company – entrusted with the task of capturing a strongly
held Pakistani Post. As the approach to the objective lay along a steep and slippery slope, the
assaulting Dogras had to go crawling. Along their way, they encountered a minefield, but
undeterred, they continued their slow and cautious approach. After a night of relentless
marching, despite facing heavy enemy machine gun fire, the Company managed to reach the
barbed wire barricade in front of the enemy's position.
Recognizing that any delay at this point would result in significant casualties for their side,
Naik Prem Singh displayed exceptional bravery. He courageously moved forward to cut a gap
in the wire, allowing his company to advance. In the process, he was struck by a bullet, and his
left hand suffered a grievous injury from a mine detonation. Despite his injuries, he crawled up
to the enemy Machine Gun bunker, removed a grenade, pulled out the pin, and threw it into the
bunker. This action resulted in the immediate elimination of all the enemy personnel inside the
bunker.
Naik Prem Singh lost consciousness due to significant blood loss. Despite his incapa",",
his section continued to engage the enemy fiercely and within half an hour of hand-to-hand
combat, the enemy fell back and retreated. Naik Prem Singh was evacuated to the Advance
Dressing section in Poonch for medical treatment.
Following the successful capture of Rani picquet, it was renamed as Chand Tekri. The capture
of both Raja and Chand Tekri effectively shattered the defensive strength of the Pakistani
Forces in this Sector. With this pivotal success, the Indian Forces encountered minimal
obstacles in clearing and eliminating the remaining pockets of resistance in the area.
For his exceptional leadership, unwavering courage, and extraordinary determination displayed
during this operation, Naik Prem Singh was honored with the #VirChakra.CITATION

Naik Prem Singh was a leading section commander of a company entrusted with the task of
capturing a strongly held Pakistani post in the Poonch sector in Jammu and Kashmir. After
marching for a night, the company, in spite of heavy enemy machine gun fire, reached the wire
barricade in front of the enemy position. Realising that delay at the assault line would entail
heavy casualties on our side, Naik Prem Singh rushed forward to cut a gap in the wire to enable
his company to move forward. While doing so, he was hit by an enemy bullet, but in spite of
the injury, completed his task and led his company to the objective, where he collapsed due to
loss of blood. By his gallant action the lives of many others of his company were saved and the
objective was captured.

Indo-Pak war, Subedar Man Bahadur Gurung was awarded the Vir Chakra for conspicuous
bravery and courage.
The first Battalion of Gurkha Regiment (now Gorkha Rifles) was raised in 1815 during the
Anglo-Nepalese war. Impressed by the qualities displayed by Gurkhas during the War, the
British started active recruitment of Gurkhas into the British Indian army. After the partition, in
1947 six Gurkha regiments viz, 1 GR, 3 GR, 4 GR, 5 GR, 8 GR and 9 GR remained with the
Indian Army, while 2 GR, 6 GR, 7 GR and 10 GR were transferred to British Army as part of
the Tripartite Agreement signed between India, Nepal and Britain. The 9 GORKHA RIFLES
was raised in 1817 at Infantry Levy at Fatehgarh as Fatehgarh Levy. In 1823, it became 63rd
Regiment a regular unit as part of the Bengal Native Infantry. Following the re-organisation
after 1857, the designation was changed to 9th Bengal Native Infantry with one of its
Companies formed by Gorkhas and other hillmen. In 1893, the regiment became a wholly
Gorkha unit before finally designated as 9th GORKHA RIFLES in 1903. The Regiment fought
in Europe during World War I and in Italy and North West Frontier during World War II. Since
independence, the Regiment has proved its mettle in Sino-India War of 1962 where it fought
under the most demanding conditions on the Namka Chu in NEFA (Now Arunachal Pradesh).
Later, the Regiment was also involved in Indo-Pak War of 1965 and 1971. 1 The Regiment’s
motto is ‘Kafar Hunu Bhanda Marnu Ramro’ (Better to die than live like a coward). In the Sino-
India war of 1962, the regiment was posted in the North-East Frontier Agency Sector (NEFA)
and fought valiantly in the crucial battles in Namka Chu Sector. The Gorkha’s have contributed

1 SIKH less two Companies, supported by 138 Mountain Battery and 17 Field Battery, attacked
the Pakistani Post on Richmar Ridge. After fierce action, by 2250 hours, Richhmar Ridge was in

Sahiba feature on the night of 25/26 August. Indian troops stealthily climbed up on the
mountain and made a bold attack for the Post. The enemy fought very hard but could not defend
their position.
The highest feature in Tithwal Sector, Sunjoi, which dominated the communication network
around the area, was also occupied by Pakistani infiltrators. To stop further infiltration into the
Sector, capture of this feature was of utmost significance. 3/8 GORKHA RIFLES, which had
been inducted into Tithwal Sector was assigned the task to capture Sunjoi feature. The Sunjoi
feature was held by 1 Company of Azad Kashmir (POK) troops and a Company plus of
Khurram Militia.

progress unless the strongly entrenched Medium and Light Machine Gun and Rocket Launchers
nests were destroyed.Realising the gravity of the situation, Subedar Gurung took another Section with him and, by a
careful and bold manouvre, secured the enemy’s right flank and fired four rockets on the enemy
strong points. Then, with his two Sections, he charged the enemy’s forward positions. Finding a
stone wall about six feet high protecting the enemy’s bunkers, he and some of his men climbed
a tree and jumped on to the bunkers. The enemy soldiers then left their positions and as they ran
back were mowed down. When Subedar Gurung’s Platoon moved forward, another enemy
Light Machine Gun opened fire from his right flank. He ordered his Light Machine Gun to
engage the enemy gun and himself crawled and went behind the enemy positions. From there he
threw two hand grenades into the enemy bunker and fired bursts from his sten gun. He then
charged inside the bunker with his Khukri cutting down the enemy gunners and this paving the
way for the further advance.

ammunition also fell into Indian hands. The Pakistani troops reacted sharply to the loss of
Sunjoi and launched two Counter-Attacks on the nights of 04/05 September and 06/07
September to regain it. Both the attacks were repulsed. Pakistan forces suffered one officer and
seven ORs killed, while Indian forces suffered lost one officer and one ORs. During this action,

been inducted into Tithwal Sector was assigned the task to capture Sunjoi feature. The Sunjoi
feature was held by 1 Company of Azad Kashmir (POK) troops and a Company plus of
Khurram Militia.
On the night of 03/04 September, 3/8 GORKHA RIFLES, supported by artillery, attacked
Sunjoi Top. After the brave charge across the minefield, and a bitter hand-to-hand fight, during
which the Khukri was freely utilized. Lance Naik Raj Bahadur Gurung was the Section
Commander of the leading Platoon of A Company. As the Platoon came close to its objective,
the enemy opened fire with Medium Machine Guns, Light Machine Guns and rockets, as a
result of which three of our men were killed. Under an order from his Platoon Commander,
Lance Naik Gurung took his Section to the right of the bunker and charged the enemy strong
points. As his Section drew close to the enemy’s positions, he noticed a stone wall about six feet
high protecting the bunkers. He climbed a tree and jumped on to the roof of the enemy bunker.
Then, rushing inside, he slaughtered the enemy gunners and captured their Medium Machine
Gun. Thereafter as a result of heavy fire brought down by his Section, the enemy left their
forward positions and started falling back, when Lance Naik Gurung killed three more enemy
soldiers. Inspired by his boldness his men made short work of many enemy bunkers and the
Pakistanis were evicted from the feature. A large quantity of ammunition fell into Indian hands.Troops of 3/8 Gorkha Rifles atop Sunjoi feature.

District of Tamil Nadu. His father’s name was P Chinnaiyan. Havildar Perumal was enrolled into
The Corps of Army Air Defence of the Indian Army on 15 September 1955 at the age of eighteen.
During the 1965 Indo Pak War, he was deployed in the Chhamb Sector of Jammu & Kashmir,
where Pakistan had planned to attack and capture the strategically crucial bridge across the Chenab
at Akhnur. With his accurate firing, Havildar Perumal managed to shoot down a Pakistani Sabre
Jet over the Akhnur Bridge. He displayed exemplary courage and devotion to duty during the
action.
The Corps of Army Air Defence traces its origins to 1939, in Pre-Independent India when Anti-
aircraft units were raised to counter Japanese air threat during World War-II. In its true sense, the
raising of the Corps of Army Air Defence began on 15 September 1940 when Number 1 Anti-
Aircraft Training Centre commenced its raising in Colaba (Mumbai) and was completed by
January 1941 in Karachi. Post-independence, it remained a part of the Regiment of Artillery and
later bifurcated as a separate arm on 10 January 1994, carving out a niche for itself as an
operational critical and technical advanced Combat Support Arm of the Indian Army. The corps
enjoyed autonomous status from 1994, after the bifurcation of the Corps of Air Defence Artillery
from the Army's Regiment of Artillery.1 A separate training school, the Army Air Defence College
(AADC), was established to train its personnel.2 On 1 November 1989, the Air Defence & Guided
Missile School and Centre was formally inaugurated as a part of Gopalpur military Cantonment.
The 'Air Defence & Guided Missile School and Centre' was rechristened as 'Army Air Defence
College' (AADC) in 1998. Later in 2008, the Army Air Defence Centre was also relocated to Army
Air Defence College. The motto of Army Air Defence is ""Aksshe Shatrun Jahi"" meaning ‘Shoot
the Enemy in Air’. The glorious history of the Corps is adorned by numerous honours and awards.
It includes four Battle Honours, four Military Crosses, two Orders of the British Empire, one Medal
of the British Empire, seven Indian Distinguished, Service Medals and two Ashok Chakras.

The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and Indian frontiers with Pakistan have remained a
sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at
several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of
Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with commendable bravery and steely
resilience, but always with great restrain to not escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak War of 1965
was the second war fought between these two bordering countries. While India was still recovering
from the damages of Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu
and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms of defence preparation. The war
initiated on 24 April 1965, when Pakistan Army, attacked our territory in the Rann of Kutch and
penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian
territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak Border Agreement 1960 and international law as per the
United Nations Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of
Operation Gibraltar.Source: http://indiastrategic.in/topstories4041_Operation_Gibraltar_was_Fundamentally_Flawed.htm
The infiltration of the Gibraltar Force at various points across the 750-km long Cease-fire Line
and the International Border between Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir began on 05 August 1965.
It covered areas of Jammu, Punch and Uri in the west, Tithwal in the North-West, Guraiz in the
North and Kargil in the North-East. Initially, about 1,500 infiltrators crossed over in small batches,
and concentrated at selected points inside Kashmir to organise themselves into larger groups. They
were equipped with light automatic weapons and their aim, apart from sabotage, was to
indoctrinate the Kashmiris so that they could revolt against India.3 The period of the infiltration
3 The Indian-Pakistan War of 1965: A History. S.N. Prasad. U.P. Thapliyal (2011). Natraj Publishers and Ministry of
Defence, Government of Indiacampaign was characterised by intense, hectic activity throughout the J&K Theatre with special
emphasis in the Valley. The raiders and own forces marched and counter-marched all over the
inhospitable terrain in a vast grim game of hide and seek. Several times during the day the
opponents met, clashed and reeled apart in a series of bloody actions, weaving a confused pattern
hard to unravel.4
The second batch of infiltrators, comprising some 6000 men, was pushed into Jammu and Kashmir
in the third week of August. Taking into account the replacements for those who ""exfiltrated"", it
is estimated that on the whole, about 8,000 infiltrators participated in these operations. By the first
week of September 1965, a third batch of infiltrators, approximately 5,500 strong, was ready in
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent across the border due to the
counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.5 The plan failed with their early detection and lack
of support from the locals, who gave away their positions.
In sheer desperation, Pakistan also employed its artillery in support of guerrilla operations in the
Chhamb area. India grasped the criticality of the ongoing plan, repulsed the attacks and cut off the
entry and exit points into the Kashmir Valley. A quick and firm response by India took Pakistan
by surprise and thwarted their well laid out plans. India reacted almost immediately by recapturing
Kargil heights which had been returned in Jul 1965, a limited offensive in the Tithwal Sector and
most importantly, the capture of Haji Pir Pass in a daring operation by 1 PARA by Major (later
Lieutenant General) Ranjit Singh Dayal under 68 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier (later
Lieutenant General) ZC Bakshi on 28 August 1965. This was one of the most notable
achievements of the riposte. The capture of Haji Pir and loss of key positions in the Kishenganga
Bulge were a severe setback for the Pakistanis which put them in a state of shock. Thus, by the
end of August 1965, Pakistan’s plans for quick annexation of the Valley had been squarely
defeated.
The failure of Operation Gibraltar saw the last phase, Operation Grand Slam put into effect by
General Ayub Khan on 01 September 1965. A massive attack was planned in the Chhamb-Jaurian
Sector aimed at capturing Akhnur, which would sever communications and cut off supply routes
to Indian troops. In desperation, Pakistan played its hand by launching Operation ‘Grand Slam’ on
01 September 1965. It was launched across the Southern most portion of the CFL and was aimed
at Akhnur; thus, Pakistan aimed at cutting of Indian positions in Naushera, Rajauri and Punch.
Thereafter, as a part of Op Grand Slam, an armoured thrust could be developed towards Jammu,

The Pakistanis opened their offensive at 0345 hours with an intense artillery and mortar
bombardment. They shelled all our forward posts along the Cease Fire Line from Red Hill to
Burejal and engaged Mandiala and Chhamb with heavy artillery fire. The gun areas came in for
special attention. The staggering weight of artillery fire continued up to 0630 hours. Under cover
of this massive fire-support, the enemy launched a three-pronged attack with a force estimated to
be an Infantry Division and two Regiments of Armour. At approximately 0830 hours, the
Pakistanis made a thrust with a Squadron of Pattons supported by Infantry. Simultaneously,

on to Manawar. Own Squadron, of 20 LANCERS commanded by Major Bhaskar Roy, reacted
sharply to these armour thrusts and managed to halt the enemy by some good shooting.
Approximately ten enemy tanks were claimed to have been knocked out.7
By 1000 hrs, Pakistan had cut off 3 MAHAR from other Indian troops, south of Dewa. One AMX
Troop, rushed from area Chhamb, was also caught on the run and destroyed by Pakistani armour.
Indian Posts at Moel, Paur and Burejal were also overrun. Advancing further, Pakistani tanks
attacked the forward defence line of 15 KUMAON and nearly overran its two forward Companies.
This brought Pakistani tanks within 450 m of Headquarters 191 Infantry Brigade. At this juncture,
in a remarkable performance, a 15 KUMAON recoilless gun destroyed the leading Pakistani tank
and knocked out the barrel of the following tank. Apprehending more recoilless and tanks in the
Mandiala area, Pakistani tanks turned Southwards.8
By last light of 01 September 1965, 191 Infantry Brigade Group was not in a position to withstand
much longer the steam roller action of the enemy. At 2050 hours on 01 September, orders were
given to the Brigade Group, less 3 MAHAR, elements 3 J & K Militia and 6/5 GORKHA RIFLES,
to withdraw to Akhnur during that night. 3 MAHAR, 6/5 GORKHA RIFLES and remnants of 3
J&K Militia were to continue holding their defences in Area Kalidhar. 191 Infantry Brigade was
made responsible for the defence of Akhnur including Akhnur Bridge and the administrative area
comprising the rear elements of the units located there. 6 RAJPUT, already deployed for the
defence of Akhnur Bridge, was placed under Command 191 Infantry Brigade.9
The 191 Infantry Brigade was made responsible for the defence of the Akhnur, including the
Akhnur Bridge. At dawn on 02 September, the focus was on the Akhnur Bridge that spanned the
Chenab. As per Pakistan’s original plan, it was to have been captured by 1200 hours the previous
day, but due to the stubborn resistance put up by elements of 6 SIKH LI, 3 MAHAR, and Charlie
Squadron of 20 LANCERS, the Pakistanis were still on the other side of the Manawar Tawi. 6
RAJPUT was holding a defensive role around the iron bridge which also had a few anti-aircraft
guns deployed around it. Second Lieutenant Govindji Mishra was positioned on the approach to
the iron structure and his orders were to not let anyone cross the river so as to keep the bridge clear
for reinforcements.10 27 AD Regiment was under 15 Corps and was also deployed for protection
of the bridge at Akhnur. It was defended by a Troop of 40mm L/60 guns. As the morning

IC-5682,Lieutenant Colonel (then Major),Megh Singh,BRIGADES OF GUARDS,"Major Megh Singh was born on 01 March 1924, to Bhoor Singh, in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. Major
Megh was part of the Patiala State Force and then taken into 3 GUARDS. He is also known for
creating the Special Forces of India. During the Indo-Pak War of 1965, he was awarded the Vir
Chakra for his exemplary courage and initiative.
The Brigade of Guards is a Regiment of the Indian Army. The troops from all parts of the
country serve in various battalions of this regiment. The regiment was formed in 1949 as the first
mixed class Indian Regiment by Field Marshal KM Cariappa OBE. The Brigade of Guards was
raised to implement the government’s policy of encouraging Army recruitment from regions
under-represented in the forces. Three of Army’s oldest battalions - 2 PUNJAB (1 GUARDS), 1
GRENADIERS (2 GUARDS), 1 RAJ RIF (3 GUARDS) and 1 RAJPUTS (4 GUARDS) were
converted as the GUARDS Battalions in 1949. Though the Brigade of Guards is only 50 years
old, its constituent battalions go back as far as 225 years. They also share 93 Battle Honours
earned around the world. At the moment, the Regiment consists of 19 Battalions. The majority of
these operate as mechanised infantry. During the first war of Kashmir 1 RAJPUT (4 GUARDS)
showed their mettle in the battle of Taindhar, where Naik Jadunath Singh fought valiantly and
won the first Param Vir Chakra for his Regiment. During the 1971 Indo-Pak War, the regiment
earned its second Param Vir Chakra through Lance Naik Albert Ekka of 14 GUARDS for
heroism in Gangasagar in the Eastern Theatre. The Regiment has also contributed a large number
of senior officers including Army Commanders to the Indian Army.
The genesis of the Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu
and Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our frontiers with
Pakistan have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing,
incursions and intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive
measures. These attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with
commendable bravery and steely resilience, but always with great restraint to not escalate the
conflict. The Indo-Pak war of 1965 was the second war fought between these two bordering
countries. While India was still recovering from the Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as an
opportunity to acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms of
defence preparation. The war began on 24 April 1965, when the Pakistan Army attacked Indian
territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This
act of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of the Indo-Pak Border
Agreement, 1960 and the international law as per the United Nations Charter. The Pakistani
forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation Gibraltar.

In 1965, Major Megh Singh was a staff officer assigned to Headquarters Western Command,
Simla. As Second in Command of 3 GUARDS, he had come under a cloud and had been passed
over for a promotion. As a result, he had put in his papers to leave the Army. Notwithstanding
this, Major Megh Singh requested an appointment with Lieutenant General Harbaksh Singh, the
GOC-in-C Western Command at the time, following the start of hostilities in J&K due to
Pakistan's major armed incursion of the region in early August 1965. In a tit-for-tat move, he
offered to organise and lead a small group that would infiltrate and attack locations behind
Pakistani fortifications in Jammu and Kashmir. He had engaged in such activities during the
Second World War in Burma behind Japanese lines and thus had requisite experience.
Major Megh Singh made an offer, which Lieutenant General Harbaksh Singh gladly accepted.
He also pledged to bestow the rank of Lieutenant Colonel on Singh if he completed the missions
he had recommended. Major Megh Singh reported to GOC XV Corps Lieutenant General KS
Katoch and was instructed to choose volunteers from Infantry Battalions. In no time at all, he
managed to gather a Squad of youthful, resilient, soldiers and began providing them with
rigorous training. After a short but intensive training, it was ready by 01 September 1965, for
operations.
In order to block the crucial entry point into the Kashmir Valley, the Indian Army launched a
daring operation to seize Haji Pir Bulge during the last week of August. The major offensive was
carried out by 68 Infantry Brigade Group under Brigadier (later Lieutenant General) ZC Bakshi
from the Uri-Baramula flank. Punch Brigade's mission was to launch a pincer strike from the
South, creating a direct path between Punch and Uri.
By striking targets hidden behind enemy lines and deflecting the enemy’s attention, Meghdoot
Force significantly contributed to this mission. Major Megh Singh offered to conduct an assault
deep within Pakistani territory. He was allowed to select any soldier he desired. He led a small
party that was tasked with breaking into Pakistani territory, conducting a raid, causing havoc, and
returning as soon as possible. Meghdoot Force was the name given to this small force named
after Major Megh Singh. In 1965, he was able to conduct three successful incursions into
Pakistan without losing any lives. Later, 9 Para Commando Battalion was established to operate
in J&K State based on this model.
During the night of 1/2 September 1965, Meghdoot Force blew up an important culvert on road
Dwarandi -Bandigopalpur, 10 km deep inside Pakistan territory. During 6/7 September, it
captured two formidable Pak Picquets - Neza Pir and Ari Dhok - in actions complementary to the
main attack on Raja and Chand Tekri picquets. After the capture of Chand Tekri, when 3
DOGRA faced difficulties near the Kahuta bridge, Meghdoot Force with bold manoeuvre drove
away the enemy from the Bridge area. The Force effected a link-up with 68 Infantry Brigade,
South of Haji Pir, on 10 September. Major Megh Singh made a creditable contribution, and for
this he was awarded the Vir Chakra.
Subsequently, Meghdoot Force shifted to the Chhamb area. It carried out harassing raids and
spread chaos and confusion behind the enemy lines. On 18 September, the Force captured an
enemy stronghold at Thil, in the Kalidhar Sector, about 4000 meters deep inside Pakistan
occupied territory after killing fifty enemy soldiers and wounding 70. Only two men of the
Meghdoot Force were wounded in this attack. Next, it raided an enemy administrative base inarea Nathal, about 12 km behind the Pakistani lines, at 0200 hours. One Company of enemy
troops, guarding the base, was completely surprised, and fled after suffering casualties. After
destroying the supply dump, the Force moved back and encountered another enemy Post in
Thuggi area at 0600 hours. In the ensuing hand-to-hand fight 22 Pakistan troops were killed and
another 40 wounded as against one OR killed and three ORs wounded on the Indian side. Major
Megh was also wounded in this action. Operations of the Meghdoot Force ended only after the
cease-fire.

In the course of Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, an extemporized Commando unit, the Meghdoot
Force of volunteers from infantry units, was created by Major Megh Singh. The unit proved very
capable, and the Indian government then authorised to properly establish a Commando unit, at
first to be a part of the Brigade of the Guards but then, in recognition of the need for a Parachute
capability, within the Parachute Regiment. Thus, the 9th Battalion (Commando) was created on
01 July 1966 with the members of the Meghdoot Force as its core. In June 1967, the unit was
divided to create a second Commando unit (the 10th Battalion). The 9th and 10th Battalions were
to operate in the Northern mountains and western desert, respectively. The Battalion were
redesignated as the 9 and 10 PARA (Commando) Battalions in 1969.Lieutenant Colonel Megh Singh being awarded the Vir Chakra

Major Megh Singh Singh was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel on 16 September 1965. Post his
superannuation from the Army, he joined the Border Security Force (BSF) and raised its
Commando Unit. He lost his son in law during Bangladesh War. Finally, he retired and went
home as DIG of BSF.
In 1973, Lieutenant Colonel Megh Singh settled down in his Village Kharia Mithapur near
Jodhpur, Rajasthan. He was the State president of Rajasthan Kisan Union for many years and
devoted his time and energy to the problems of farmers in that region. Lieutenant Colonel Megh
Singh passed away in 2010 at the age of eighty-eight.","Lieutenant Colonel Megh Singh (IC-5682), The Guards Regiment.
(Effective date of awards– 1st of September 1965)
Lieutenant Colonel Megh Singh of Headquarters Western Command, who, as a Major, was
attached to a Brigade Headquarters in Jammu and Kashmir for command duties, successfully
conducted three important raids into enemy territory during the period from the 1st to the 11th
September 1965. On the night of the 2nd/3rd September 1965, his force blew up a big culvert on
the Kotli-Bandigopalpur road disrupting the enemy’s line of communication inside their territory.
On the 6th September, his column captured the two important picquets–Neja Pir and Ari Dhok.
Again, on the 10th September 1965 his column went 2 miles deep into enemy territory and
effected the Uri-Poonch link-up at Kahuta in spite of heavy enemy fire.
In all these actions, by his exemplary courage and initiative, Lieutenant Colonel Megh
Singh inspired confidence in the force of Volunteers under him, causing confusion and casualties
in the enemy camps and facilitating the success of the Brigade’s operational plan.

IC-8519,Major,Jitinder Kumar,15 DOGRA,"Major Jitinder Kumar was born on 24 March 1936 at Multan in present day Pakistan.
During partition, his family migrated to India and settled in Panipat, Haryana. His father’s name
was Shri Dina Nath Chhetri. Major Jitinder Kumar did his schooling from Government High
School, Panipat. He was commissioned into 15 DOGRA of the Indian Army on 09 June 1957.
During the 1965 Indo Pak War, he was Commanding a Company in the Lahore Sector. where he
fought gallantly, when to avoid getting strafed by an enemy Sabre aircraft, he disregarded his
personal safety and single handedly shot down one F-86 Sabre with a Light Machine Gun. Later,
Major Jitinder Kumar Commanded 7 DOGRA for two years as Lieutenant Colonel before retiring
from active service.1
The DOGRA Regiment, raised in 1877 is one of the older infantry regiments of the Indian Army.
The Regiment traces its roots directly from the 17th Dogra Regiment of the British Indian Army.
After World War I, the British Indian government restructured the army, moving from Regiments
with a single Battalion to multi–Battalion Regiments. In 1945, it shed the numeral ‘17’ and became
Dogra Regiment. The DOGRA Regiment has troops from Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir,
and the Northern districts of Punjab. Their Regimental war cry is “Jwala Mata Ki Jai” (Victory to
Goddess Jwala). The Dogras have participated in all the wars and conflicts fought by the Indian
Army since independence and winning laurels. General N C Vij, PVSM, UYSM, AVSM who was
the 21st Chief of the Army also belonged to the DOGRA Regiment.

and the International Border between Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir began on 05 August 1965.
1 The Military Heroes of Haryana. Gallantry Award Winners. Volume 1. Lt Col Dilbag Singh Dabas. (2021)
Rolleract Press Services, A84, Naraina Ind. Area Phase-1, New Delhi, IndiaIt covered areas of Jammu, Punch and Uri in the West, Tithwal in the North-West, Guraiz in the
North and Kargil in the North-East. Initially, about 1,500 infiltrators crossed over in small batches,
and concentrated at selected points inside Kashmir to organise themselves into larger groups. They
were equipped with light automatic weapons and their aim, apart from sabotage, was to
indoctrinate the Kashmiris so that they could revolt against India.2 The period of the infiltration
campaign was characterised by intense, hectic activity throughout the J&K Theatre with special
emphasis in the Valley. The raiders and own forces marched and counter-marched all over the
inhospitable terrain in a vast grim game of hide and seek. Several times during the day the
opponents met, clashed and reeled apart in a series of bloody actions, weaving a confused pattern
hard to unravel.3
The second batch of infiltrators, comprising some 6000 men, was pushed into Jammu and Kashmir
in the third week of August. Taking into account the replacements for those who ""exfiltrated"", it
is estimated that on the whole, about 8,000 infiltrators participated in these operations. By the first
week of September 1965, a third batch of infiltrators, approximately 5,500 strong, was ready in
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent across the border due to the
counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.4 The plan failed with their early detection and lack
of support from the locals, who gave away their positions.
In sheer desperation, Pakistan also employed its artillery in support of guerrilla operations in the
Chhamb area. India grasped the criticality of the ongoing plan, repulsed the attacks and cut off the
entry and exit points into the Kashmir Valley. A quick and firm response by India took Pakistan
by surprise and thwarted their well laid out plans. India reacted almost immediately by recapturing
Kargil heights which had been returned in Jul 1965, a limited offensive in the Tithwal Sector and
most importantly, the capture of Haji Pir Pass in a daring operation by 1 PARA by Major (later
Lieutenant General) Ranjit Singh Dayal under 68 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier (later
Lieutenant General) ZC Bakshi on 28 August 1965. This was one of the most notable
achievements of the riposte. The capture of Haji Pir and loss of key positions in the Kishenganga
Bulge were a severe setback for the Pakistanis which put them in a state of shock. Thus, by the
end of August 1965, Pakistan’s plans for quick annexation of the Valley had been squarely
defeated.

The failure of Operation Gibraltar saw the last Phase, Operation Grand Slam put into effect by
General Ayub Khan on 01 September 1965. Pakistan did not call off Operation ‘Grand Slam'
despite the security council's call for an immediate cease-fire on 4 September 1965. It even carried
out an air raid on Amritsar the next day. The Indian warning that an attack against Jammu and
Kashmir would be treated as an attack against India was also ignored by Pakistan. Meanwhile,
apprehending a Pakistani attack, India had also formulated a contingency plan to meet the situation
militarily. The Indian plan visualised a limited offensive intended to cover the area from Dera
Baba Nanak in the North to the Sutlej in the South.Punjab Theatre: 1965 Indo Pak War

The objective of the retaliatory Indian plan was to threaten Lahore, drive a wedge between the
Pakistani forces deployed in the Lahore and Sialkot sectors and destroy their war potential. The
offensive was to serve the dual purpose of ensuring the security of Punjab by advancing the Indian
defence line to the Ichhogil Canal and to capture some Pakistani territory to serve as a bargaining
lever in the political parleys, on the conclusion of hostilities.
In view of the above plan, XI Corps under Lieutenant General JS Dhillon was assigned the tasks
on August 1965 to destroy the enemy forces which might enter Punjab and Ganganagar Sector in
Rajasthan. Also, on orders from Lieutenant General Harbaksh Singh, GOC-in-C Western
Command, the Corps was to undertake the following measures simultaneously:
a. To advance to the Ichhogil Canal along the axes GT road, Bhikkiwind-Khalra and
Bhikkiwind-Khem Karan, to secure Pakistani territory from opposite Ranian inclusive toits junction with Dipalpur Canal opposite Hussainiwala. Also to capture intact Ichhogil
Uttar road bridge, GT road bridge, Jallo road bridge and Barki Bridge on Ichhogil Canal
b. To eliminate the Pakistani bridge-head at the Dera Baba Nanak and if possible, capture the
bridge on the Ravi River, intact.
The initial task of XI Corps was to secure the East bank of the Ichhogil Canal and establish
bridgeheads across the Canal at some points. Surprise was achieved and the three Indian Divisions
gained notable success. In the South, 4 Mountain Division, under Maj Gen Gurbakhsh Singh,
launched an attack on the Khem Karan-Kasur axis and succeeded in capturing all its objectives,
either wholly or partially, by 1230 hours on 06 September. Further North, 7 Infantry Division,
under Maj Gen H K Sibal, captured Hudiara by 1030 hours. 15 Infantry Division under Maj Gen
Niranjan Prasad achieved some early success. One of its Battalions, 3 JAT crossed the Ichhogil
Canal at Dograi and reached Batapore on the outskirts of Lahore. Another Battalion of the Division
advanced up to the road bridge over this Canal near Bhaini Dhilwal, 9 km North of Dograi. The
bridge over the Ravi River at Dera Baba Nanak was captured by 29 Infantry Brigade. These
attacks, launched with speed and vigour, jolted Pakistan.

The second batch of infiltrators, comprising some 6000 men, was pushed into Jammu and Kashmir
in the third week of August. Taking into account the replacements for those who ""exfiltrated"", it
is estimated that on the whole, about 8,000 infiltrators participated in these operations. By the first
week of September 1965, a third batch of infiltrators, approximately 5,500 strong, was ready in
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent across the border due to the
counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.3 The plan failed with their early detection and lack
of support from the locals, who gave away their positions.
In sheer desperation, Pakistan also employed its artillery in support of guerrilla operations in the
Chhamb area. India grasped the criticality of the ongoing plan, repulsed the attacks and cut off the
entry and exit points into the Kashmir Valley. A quick and firm response by India took Pakistan
by surprise and thwarted their well laid out plans. India reacted almost immediately by recapturing
Kargil heights which had been returned in Jul 1965, a limited offensive in the Tithwal Sector and
most importantly, the capture of Haji Pir Pass in a daring operation by 1 PARA by Major (later
Lieutenant General) Ranjit Singh Dayal under 68 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier (later
Lieutenant General) ZC Bakshi on 28 August 1965. This was one of the most notable
achievements of the riposte. The capture of Haji Pir and loss of key positions in the Kishenganga
Bulge were a severe setback for the Pakistanis which put them in a state of shock. Thus, by the
end of August 1965, Pakistan’s plans for quick annexation of the Valley had been squarely
defeated.
The failure of Operation Gibraltar saw the last Phase, Operation Grand Slam put into effect by
General Ayub Khan on 01 September 1965. A massive attack was planned in the Chhamb-Jaurian
Sector aimed at capturing Akhnur, which would sever communications and cut off supply routes
to Indian troops. In desperation, Pakistan played its hand by launching Operation ‘Grand Slam’ on
01 September 1965. It was launched across the Southern most portion of the CFL and was aimed
at Akhnur; thus, Pakistan aimed at cutting of Indian positions in Naushera, Rajauri and Punch.
Thereafter, as a part of Operation Grand Slam, an armoured thrust could be developed towards
Jammu, the capture of which would have severed all land communications to Jammu & Kashmir.4

Pakistan did not call off Operation ‘Grand Slam' despite the security council's call for an immediate
cease-fire on 4 September 1965. It even carried out an air raid on Amritsar the next day. The Indian
warning that an attack against Jammu and Kashmir would be treated as an attack against India was
also ignored by Pakistan. Meanwhile, apprehending a Pakistani attack, India had also formulated
a contingency plan to meet the situation militarily. The Indian plan visualised a limited offensive
intended to cover the area from Dera Baba Nanak in the north to the Sutlej in the south.

The objective of the retaliatory Indian plan was to threaten Lahore, drive a wedge between the
Pakistani forces deployed in the Lahore and Sialkot sectors and destroy their war potential. Theoffensive was to serve the dual purpose of ensuring the security of Punjab by advancing the Indian
defence line to the Ichhogil Canal and to capture some Pakistani territory to serve as a bargaining
lever in the political parleys, on the conclusion of hostilities.
In view of the above plan, the XI Corps was assigned the tasks on August 1965 to destroy the
enemy forces which might enter Punjab and Ganganagar sector in Rajasthan. Also, on orders from
GOC-in-C Western Command, the Corps was to undertake the following measures
simultaneously:
a. To advance to the Ichhogil Canal along the axes GT road, Bhikkiwind-Khalra and
Bhikkiwind-Khem Karan, to secure Pakistani territory from opposite Ranian inclusive to
its junction with Dipalpur Canal opposite Hussainiwala. Also to capture intact Ichhogil
Uttar road bridge, GT road bridge, Jallo road bridge and Barki bridge on Ichhogil Canal
b. To eliminate the Pakistani bridge-head at the Dera Baba Nanak and if possible, capture the
bridge on the Ravi River, intact.
On completion of above, they were to be prepared to advance on Lahore. 4 Mountain Division
(less 33 Mountain Brigade) was part of the XI Corps was to secure Pakistani territory up to the
East Bank of the Ichhogil Canal from the Canal Junction near Bedian (exclusive) to the Pt 798439
at Ganda Singhwala (inclusive). It was also to destroy the bridge over the Ichhogil Canal on Road
Khem Karan – Kasur and occupy a defended sector to contain possible Pakistani offensive
particularly along the Kasur - Khem Karan and the Ganda Singhwala - Khem Karan axes. For this,
the support of 2(Independent) Armoured Brigade would be made available on priority.5
The Khem Karan Sector was a complex labyrinth of roads and water channels, where, on the face
of it, Pakistan had a distinct advantage should it go on the offensive. Khem Karan and Kasur were
virtually twin townships. The Ichhogil in this sector was at an average 2 to 3 km from the border
and along with the Rohi Nullah was an obstacle for any offensive towards Kasur.

XI Corps’ operational instructions were based on the assumption that Pakistan’s 10 Infantry
Division was solely responsible for the defence of the Lahore Sector and 106 Infantry Brigade
under Brigadier Nawazish Ali on the Kasur–Khem Karan axis was reporting to Major General
Sarfraz Khan as the formation’s fourth Brigade. 4 Mountain Division was expected to reach the
East bank of the Ichhogil Canal with the minimum difficulty, capture and blow up the bridges, and
then deploy in a compact defensive position on the East bank itself before the Pakistanis could
react.
Unfortunately, The Pakistani forward positions were alert and 9 JAK RIF commanded by
Lieutenant Colonel (later Major) Goverdhan Singh ‘G S’ Jamwal came under machine gun and
artillery fire right from the start. However, supported by tanks and counter bombardment, 9 JAK
RIF secured the road crossing over the Rohi Nullah. 13 DOGRA, commanded by Lieutenant
Colonel G C Khosla, sent Alpha and Delta Company across the bridge to capture the high ground
at Rohiwal. Coming under intense small arms and artillery fire, the Dogras immediately started
taking casualties. Though Alpha Company under Captain J S Thakur captured the objective, fire
from well-concealed positions took a heavy toll on Delta Company. It finally took four hours offighting before Charlie Company cleared the surrounding areas. While the Dogras were slugging
it out around Rohiwal, to the right of the Kasur Road, Charlie Squadron of DECCAN HORSE
under the command of Major (later Major General) D K Mehta was having difficulty crossing the
Dode Drain and only five tanks managed to get across to support 4 GRENADIER’s attack on Theh
Pannu.6
It was during this action, Lieutenant Teja Singh of 9 JAK RIF, who was in command of a
Company, held on to his objective at Khem Karan on the India-Pakistan border on the 06 and the
07 September 1965, in the face of heavy enemy ground and air shelling and averted the enemy
attack. When his Company ran short of ammunition and water and there was no communication
with his Battalion Headquarters, he personally went and contacted his Headquarters amidst heavy
enemy shelling; and withdrew his men safely according to plan.
Throughout the action, Lieutenant Teja Singh displayed exemplary courage, leadership and
determination of a high order. He was awarded Vir Chakra for his gallantry.

District in Kerala. His father’s name was Shri V K Raman Nambiar. Subedar Nambiar was
enrolled into 4 MADRAS Regiment of the Indian Army on 05 June 1948 at the age of twenty.
During the 1965 Indo Pak War, he was deployed in Sialkot Sector, where he despite not being in
a Rifle Company, he mustered a Section of the Signal Platoon and charged an enemy Medium
Machine Gun position that was holding the Battalion’s assault and sacrificed himself for the nation.
The origin of the MADRAS Regiment in its present form can be traced to the time when the Levis
were organised into companies of 100 men each, and two Battalions were thus raised on 4
December 1758 and placed under the command of Lord Robert Clive to defend Fort St. George at
Madras. Thus, the Madras Regiment is one of the oldest Regiments of the Indian Infantry. The
Regiment recruits its soldiers from the five Southern states – Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh,
Telangana, and Karnataka. The valour of the Madras Regiment was seen when it fought fierce
battles during most military operations of independent India. Their regimental war cry is “Veer
madrassi, adi kollu, adi kollu, adi kollu” meaning “O brave Madrassi, hit and kill, hit and kill, hit
and kill.” In glorious 265 Years of its existence, the Regiment has a total 45 Battle Honours, 14
Theatre Honours, 11 COAS unit","s, 52 GOC-in-C Unit Appreciations, 5 UN Force
Commander Citations, one Ashoka Chakra, five Mahavir Chakra, 11 Kirti Chakra, 36 Vir Chakra,

The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and Indian frontiers with Pakistan have remained a
sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at
several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of
Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with commendable bravery and steely
resilience, but always with great restrain to not escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak War of 1965
was the second war fought between these two bordering countries. While India was still recovering
from the damages of Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu
and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms of defence preparation. The war
initiated on 24 April 1965, when Pakistan Army, attacked our territory in the Rann of Kutch and
penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian
territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak Border Agreement 1960 and international law as per the
United Nations Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of
Operation Gibraltar.Source: http://indiastrategic.in/topstories4041_Operation_Gibraltar_was_Fundamentally_Flawed.htm
The infiltration of the Gibraltar Force at various points across the 750-km long Cease-fire Line
and the International Border between Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir began on 05 August 1965.
It covered areas of Jammu, Punch and Uri in the west, Tithwal in the North-West, Guraiz in the
North and Kargil in the North-East. Initially, about 1,500 infiltrators crossed over in small batches,
and concentrated at selected points inside Kashmir to organise themselves into larger groups. They
were equipped with light automatic weapons and their aim, apart from sabotage, was to
indoctrinate the Kashmiris so that they could revolt against India.1 The period of the infiltration
campaign was characterised by intense, hectic activity throughout the J&K Theatre with special
emphasis in the Valley. The raiders and own forces marched and counter-marched all over the
inhospitable terrain in a vast grim game of hide and seek. Several times during the day the

hard to unravel.2
The second batch of infiltrators, comprising some 6000 men, was pushed into Jammu and Kashmir
in the third week of August. Taking into account the replacements for those who ""exfiltrated"", it
is estimated that on the whole, about 8,000 infiltrators participated in these operations. By the first

criticality of the ongoing plan, repulsed the attacks and cut off the entry and exit points into the
Kashmir Valley. A quick and firm response by India took Pakistan by surprise and thwarted their
well laid out plans.
To ease Pakistan's pressure on Chhamb, India opened a second front in Sialkot Sector. It was
strategically a vital area and a threat to it was likely to hurt Pakistan most. Loss of Sialkot would
have made Pakistan's position in Chhamb untenable and therefore, any Indian move in that
direction would have created a great scare in Pakistan. On the other hand, it would have served the
Indian interest very well indeed. This second diversionary move was launched by I corps, led by
Lieutenant General PO Dunn, on 08 September, 1965.

The Operations in Samba-Jammu-Sialkot Sector covered the area between the Ravi and the
Chenab Rivers, with the Indo-Pak border running close to the foothills in the East. The road-link
between J&K and the rest of India runs through a narrow stretch of the lower foothills, parallel to
the border. The International Border is 28 km from Jammu and 14 km from Sialkot, a major
Pakistani communication centre. Sialkot was connected with Lahore by rail via Wazirabad-
Gujranwala, and also via Pasrur-Narowal and Pakistani supplies to the Chhamb sector passed
through it. The Sialkot- Pasrur stretch of this railway line was a vital link in the Pakistani defence
system. Chawinda was a small town of strategic importance on the Sialkot- Pasrur railway line.
HQ I Corps under Lieutenant General PO Dunn had been located at Kaluchak (neař Jammu) by 04
September. Troops made available to the Corps included the following:
a) 1 Armoured Division (Major General Rajinder Singh, MVC)
b) 6 Mountain Division (Major General SK Korla, DSO, MC)
c) 14 Infantry Division (Major General RK Ranjeet Singh)
d) 26 Infantry Division (Major General ML Thapan)
I Corps was assigned the task of securing area Pagowal (Bhagowal), Phillora (Phillaurah),
Chawinda, and the Cross Roads with a view to advancing towards the Marala-Ravi Link Canal,and eventually to the line of Dhallewali-Wuhilam-Daska-Mandhali.? The operation was code-
named 'Operation Nepaľ.
By last light on 07 September, I Corps had made all preparations to cross the International Border
on a frontage extending from Degh Nadi to Suchetgarh. All formations were deployed as per the
plan, except for 14 Infantry Division, as its 58 Infantry Brigade, deployed at Madhopur Road
Bridge and the Headworks, could not be relieved. 28 Infantry Brigade, which had been allocated
to 6 Mountain Division, also could not join as it was deeply involved in Chhamb Sector. At 2300
hours on the night of 07/08 September, 6 Mountain Division and 26 Infantry Division crossed the
International Border into Pakistan. 'Operation Nepal' was on the move.4

The attack on Maharajke by 69 Mountain Brigade was planned in two phases. In Phase I, 3
MADRAS and 9 KUMAON, were to capture the right half of the objective and block the road to
Pagowal/Badiana and Sialkot. In Phase II, 4 MADRAS was to capture the left half of the objective,and block the road to Charwa and Zafarwal. By 1700 hours on 07 September, two Companies of
4 MADRAS secured the Forming Up Place to the South-East of Jabwal Kalan. At 2250 hours 3
MADRAS and 9 KUMAON formed up and launched the operation at 2300 hours. The right half
of the objective was secured against light enemy opposition (company plus) by 0130 hours. Phase
II of the operation was launched by 4 MADRAS at 0300 hours. But soon heavy MMG and small
arms fire held up the assault. At this stage, Lieutenant Colonel HL Mehta, the Commanding
Officer, rushed forward to lead the assault and the objective was secured by 0530 hours. In this
battle, Lieutenant Colonel Mehta led one of his reserve Companies in person. Inspired by his
presence in the in a tactically sound outflanking move. foremost line of attack, the men pressed

Punjab. His father’s name was Sardar Ishar Singh. Risaldar Achhar Singh was enrolled into 9
HORSE (Deccan Horse) of the Indian Army on 12 July 1939. During the 1965 Indo Pak War, he
was part of an attack on the Rohi Bund near Khem Karan in Punjab where he displayed his skills
and destroyed an enemy tank and damaged another.
The DECCAN HORSE was raised from two old Hyderabad raised Regiments the 20th ROYAL
DECCAN HORSE and the 29th LANCERS (Deccan Horse). The Nizam of Hyderabad had been
persuaded to have his Army officered by Britishers and this decision had been popular with the
Army. It was in 1816 that Captain Evans Davies arrived in the State and four Cavalry Regiments
were created which became the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th Regiments Nizam's Cavalry. The 4th was to
be raised in 1826. In 1854. the Cavalry force was reduced to four Regiments and had already won
the approval of Lord Gough, then Commander-in-Chief, India who, in 1853, before a House of
Commons Committee had called the Nizam's Cavalry 'the finest Irregular Cavalry in the world.
Their new designation was to be the 1st to 4th Cavalry, Hyderabad Contingent. The Great Mutiny
saw the Contingent on Service in Central India. In 1880, they were equipped with the lance but
the designation was not changed until 1890 when they became the 1st to 4th LANCERS,
Hyderabad Contingent. Until 1903, with the incorporation of the Hyderabad Contingent into the
regular Cavalry, the contingents were designated as the 20th DECCAN HORSE (1st) and the 29th
LANCERS (DECCAN HORSE) (2nd). Both the 20th and 29th served in France in the Great War
and then and when the Indian Cavalry Corps moved to Palestine, both Regiments served in the
Jordan Valley and in Allenby’s final victorious campaign. 20TH DECCAN HORSE was titled
'ROYAL' for distinguished service during World War I. It was the only regiment to be so honoured.
In 1922, following amalgamation of the two Regiments; the ROYAL DECCAN HORSE (9
HORSE) came into being. During World War II, out of the four Regiments that were allocated
tanks, PROBYN’S HORSE and the ROYAL DECCAN HORSE were the Indian Regiments of
251 Indian Tank Brigade.1 During Partition, the Regiment was allotted to India and its name was
finally changed to THE DECCAN HORSE (9 HORSE) in 1950. Since Independence, THE
DECCAN HORSE has fought in the three wars with Pakistan; 1947-48, 1965 and 1971. The battles
fought by the Regiment broke the back of the enemy Armoured and Infantry division. The
Regiment has blunted and stalled the largest offensives mounted by Pakistan since Independence.

Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent across the border due to the
counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.5 The plan failed with their early detection and lack
of support from the locals, who gave away their positions.
5 The Indian-Pakistan War of 1965: A History. S.N. Prasad. U.P. Thapliyal (2011). Natraj Publishers and Ministry
of Defence, Government of IndiaIn sheer desperation, Pakistan also employed its artillery in support of guerrilla operations in the
Chhamb area. India grasped the criticality of the ongoing plan, repulsed the attacks and cut off the
entry and exit points into the Kashmir Valley. A quick and firm response by India took Pakistan
by surprise and thwarted their well laid out plans. India reacted almost immediately by recapturing
Kargil heights which had been returned in Jul 1965, a limited offensive in the Tithwal Sector and
most importantly, the capture of Haji Pir Pass in a daring operation by 1 PARA by Major (later
Lieutenant General) Ranjit Singh Dayal under 68 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier (later
Lieutenant General) ZC Bakshi on 28 August 1965. This was one of the most notable
achievements of the riposte. The capture of Haji Pir and loss of key positions in the Kishenganga
Bulge were a severe setback for the Pakistanis which put them in a state of shock. Thus, by the
end of August 1965, Pakistan’s plans for quick annexation of the Valley had been squarely
defeated.
The failure of Operation Gibraltar saw the last Phase, Operation Grand Slam put into effect by
General Ayub Khan on 01 September 1965. A massive attack was planned in the Chhamb-Jaurian
Sector aimed at capturing Akhnur, which would sever communications and cut off supply routes
to Indian troops. In desperation, Pakistan played its hand by launching Operation ‘Grand Slam’ on
01 September 1965. It was launched across the Southern most portion of the CFL and was aimed
at Akhnur; thus, Pakistan aimed at cutting of Indian positions in Naushera, Rajauri and Punch.
Thereafter, as a part of Operation Grand Slam, an armoured thrust could be developed towards
Jammu, the capture of which would have severed all land communications to Jammu & Kashmir.6
This would place Pakistan in a position to dictate terms to India.
Pakistan did not call off Operation ‘Grand Slam' despite the Security Council's call for an
immediate cease-fire on 04 September 1965. It even carried out an air raid on Amritsar the next
day. The Indian warning that an attack against Jammu and Kashmir would be treated as an attack
against India was also ignored by Pakistan. Meanwhile, apprehending a Pakistani attack, India had
also formulated a contingency plan to meet the situation militarily. The Indian plan visualised a
limited offensive intended to cover the area from Dera Baba Nanak in the North to the Sutlej in
the South.

The objective of the retaliatory Indian plan was to threaten Lahore, drive a wedge between the
Pakistani forces deployed in the Lahore and Sialkot Sectors and destroy their war potential. The
offensive was to serve the dual purpose of ensuring the security of Punjab by advancing the Indian
defence line to the Ichhogil Canal and to capture some Pakistani territory to serve as a bargaining
lever in the political parleys, on the conclusion of hostilities.
In view of the above plan, XI Corps under Lieutenant General Joginder Singh Dhillon was assigned
the tasks on August 1965 to destroy the enemy forces which might enter Punjab and Ganganagar
Sector in Rajasthan. Also, on orders from GOC-in-C Western Command, the Corps was to
undertake the following measures simultaneously:
a. To advance to the Ichhogil Canal along the axes GT road, Bhikkiwind-Khalra and
Bhikkiwind-Khem Karan, to secure Pakistani territory from opposite Ranian inclusive toits junction with Dipalpur Canal opposite Hussainiwala. Also to capture intact Ichhogil
Uttar road bridge, GT road bridge, Jallo road bridge and Barki bridge on Ichhogil Canal
b. To eliminate the Pakistani bridge-head at the Dera Baba Nanak and if possible, capture the
bridge on the Ravi River, intact.

https://stratnewsglobal.com/pakistan/1965-war-the-battle-for-haji-pir/
On completion of above, they were to be prepared to advance on Lahore. 4 Mountain Division
(less 33 Mountain Brigade) was part of the XI Corps and was to secure Pakistani territory up to
the east bank of the Ichhogil Canal from the Canal Junction near Bedian (exclusive) to the Pt
798439 at Ganda Singhwala (inclusive). It was also to destroy the bridge over the Ichhogil Canal
on Road Khem Karan – Kasur and occupy a defended sector to contain possible Pakistani offensive
particularly along the Kasur - Khem Karan and the Ganda Singhwala - Khem Karan axes. For this,the support of 2 Independent Armoured Brigade would be made available on priority.7 The Khem
Karan Sector was a complex labyrinth of roads and water channels, where, on the face of it,
Pakistan had a distinct advantage should it go on the offensive. Khem Karan and Kasur were
virtually twin townships. The Ichhogil in this sector was at an average 2 to 3 km from the border
and along with the Rohi Nullah was an obstacle for any offensive towards Kasur.
4 Mountain Division planned to carry out the allotted tasks in two phases. In the first phase,
territory up to the East bank of the Ichhogil Canal from Ballanwala to Ganda Singhwala was to be
captured by a Brigade group. In the second phase, territory up to the East of the Ichhogil Canal
from Canal junction at Bedian to Ballanwala was to be captured by another Brigade group less
Battalion. At 0330 hours on 06 September, HQ XI Corps ordered that the territory to the east of
the Ichhogil should be secured with utmost speed, unmindful of casualties. It also clarified that the
compact defended sector should be occupied covering the Kasur-Khem Karan and Ganda
Singhwala-Khem Karan axes. The intelligence available to the Division indicated that Pakistan
had deployed only the Sutlej Rangers and Mujahids to the East of the Ichhogil Canal and that at
the most, one Infantry battalion held hastily prepared positions from Bedian to Ganda Singhwala.
In fact, India did not expect a quick major counter-offensive from Pakistan. In view of this, it was
concluded that quick occupation of the east bank of Rohi Nala would delay a Pakistani armour
thrust, enable Indians to cause more attrition and economise troop involvement on various axes of
the Pakistani advance. The Division plan, therefore, envisaged:
Phase 1
(i) Securing of Pakistani territory upto the east bank of the Rohi Nala from Road-Nala
junction to the Rohiwal area by 62 Mountain Brigade Group.
(ii) Occupation of the defended sector by 62 Mountain Brigade Group with an additional
battalion under command, in the west and south-west of Khem Karan area covering
Kasur-Khem Karan and Ganda Singhwala-Khem Karan axes.
Phase 2
(i) Capture of Ballanwala-Theh Pannun and securing of Pakistani territory east of the
Ichhogil Canal from Ballanwala (including) to 162 Canal junction near Bedian (excluding)
by 7 Mountain Brigade Group less one battalion.
(ii) Securing of the east bank of Ichhogil Canal from Ballanwala (excluding) to Ganda
Singhwala by 62 Mountain Brigade and destruction of the bridge over Ichhogil Canal on
the Khem Karan-Kasur Road.
7 The Indian-Pakistan War of 1965: A History. S.N. Prasad. U.P. Thapliyal (2011). Natraj Publishers and Ministry
of Defence, Government of IndiaIn view of the impending operations, a firm base was established in the South- West of Khem
Karan by 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES, 18 RAJPUTANA RIFLES and 9 HORSE less two Squadrons.
At 0500 hours on 06 September, 62 Mountain Brigade advanced to secure area Rohiwal and the
road crossing over Rohi Nala. 9 JAK RIFLES, which had captured Rohi Nala on the main axis at
about 0915 hours was directed to push through and destroy the bridge on the Ichhogil and occupy
its nearest bank. But the Battalion came under heavy artillery and MMG fire from the Canal area.
13 DOGRA, however, succeeded in securing the Rohiwal area by 1030 hours, despite mortar and
MMG fire. It suffered two killed and seven injured (including two officers) in the encounter. Two
Battalions of 7 Mountain Brigade, viz 7 GRENADIERS and 4 GRENADIERS, advanced on
Ballanwala and Theh Pannun respectively. By 1130 hours on 06 September, 4 GRENADIERS
secured the line of Rohi Nala and the East bank of the Ichhogil southwards of Theh Pannun. But
the attack of 7 GRENADIERS on Ballanwala failed.
During this action, on 07 September 1965, when the Deccan Horse took part in an attack on the
Rohi Bund near Khem Karan on the India-Pakistan border, Risaldar Achhar Singh of 9 HORSE
handled his troop with skill and courage. He destroyed an enemy tank and damaged another

was awarded the VirChakra for conspicuous bravery and courage on during the 1965 Indo- Pak

The Sikh Regiment is one of the highest decorated regiments of the Indian Army. It came into
existence on 01 August 1846, with the raising of Regiment of Ferozepore Sikhs and Regiment
of Ludhiana Sikhs by Captain G Tebbs and Lieutenant Colonel P Gordon respectively. They
participated effectively in the 1857 First War of Independence. This war revealed the valour and
fighting tenacity of the Sikh soldiers. They soon earned a rank of seniority over other Indian
Sepoys. Under the British Indian Army, the Sikh Regiment fought gallantly in a number of war
and battles including the Battle of Saragarhi in which they left an indelible mark in the
Regiment’s history. By 1914 the Sikh Regiment was deployed as part of British Indian Army for
operations in World War I. The Regiment served in all theatres of operations and earned 28
battle honours. The modern Sikh Regiment traces its roots directly from the 11th Sikh Regiment
of the British Indian Army. When transferred to the Indian Army post-Independence, the
numeral 11 was removed and new battalions were added. 1 SIKH was later mechanised in 1970
and re-designated as 4 MECHANISED INFANTRY on 02 April 1979.
The genesis of the Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu
and Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our frontiers with
Pakistan have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing,
incursions and intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive
measures. These attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with
commendable bravery and steely resilience, but always with great restraint to not escalate the
conflict. The Indo-Pak war of 1965 was the second war fought between these two bordering
countries. While India was still recovering from the Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as
an opportunity to acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms
of defence preparation. The war began on 24 April 1965, when the Pakistan Army attacked
Indian territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory.
This act of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of the Indo-Pak Border
Agreement ,1960 and the international law as per the United Nations Charter. The Pakistani
forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation Gibraltar.
Major General HK Sibal, GOC 7 Infantry Division which was permanently located at Ferozepur
was tasked with capturing Barki and mopping up the Pakistanis on the East Bank of the Ichhogil
Canal, two Infantry Brigades and Central India Horse commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Satish
Chand Joshi were allocated for this task. Barki was located on the road that ran from Harike in
India to Lahore. The town sat astride the Ichhogil Canal and was 9.5 kms from the IB and 24
kms from Lahore. The Upper Buchar Distributary and the Hudiara Drain were the two major
obstacles on the way to Barki. The built-up areas of Hudiara, Nurpur, Barka Kalan and Barka
Khrud lay on the approaches to Barki and were well defended. The defences were formidable,
concrete pill boxes and had adequate artillery support.
On the 06 September 1965, 4 SIKH commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Anant Singh crossed the
IB at 0400 hours as the vanguard of 65 Infantry Brigade offensive thrust on the Kharla- Barki
axis and capturing two small villages just across the border on the left-hand side of the road.
Alpha Company under Major Shamsher Singh Manhas had captured Theh Sarja Majra while
Bravo Company under Major Dalip Sidhu had captured the Ranger Post at Rakh Hardit Singh.
This facilitated the firm base of the Brigade to be established right at the border. 16 PUNJAB
commanded by Lieutenant Colonel (later Major General) JS Bhullar then entered Pakistani
territory at 0530 hours and captured Ghiwandi Post held by elements of 11 FF (R&S). Whilethese two battalions cleared and guarded the flanks 48 Infantry Brigade under Brigadier KJS
Shahney went straight for Hudiara Drain. The leading elements of the Brigade 6/8 GORKHA
RIFLES was leading the advance with Alpha Squadron CIH commanded by Major Narinder
Dogra, there was no opposition till they reached the drain where Pakistan’s Delta Company of
17 Punjab and B Company of 11 FF (R&S) were deployed. By 1030 hours the East Bank of the
Drain and Hudiara village were secured but they could move no further due to continuous fire.
Two officers, one JCO and nine ORs were killed while twenty five were wounded. 5 GUARDS
was now ordered to capture Nurpur in an outflanking manouvre forcing the rest of the
Pakistanis to withdraw from the Hudiara Drain but not before they blew up the 140 foot Bridge.
Nurpur village was finally captured at 1730 hours.
As 65 Infantry Brigade had suffered heavy casualties Major General HK Sibal ordered
Brigadier Lerb Ferris, Commander 65 Infantry Brigade, to resume advance at 0700 hours next
morning, by which time the Bailey bridge over the Hudiara Drain was expected to be ready. The
GOC appreciated the Pakistani strength in the area at two Infantry Battalions, supported by a
Squadron of armour and a Regiment of Artillery, reduced of course by the casualties suffered at
Hudiara. He allotted the following additional troops to the Brigade:
a) Under Command – Central Indian Horse (Shermans) less one Squadron; 94 Field
Company; and Tentacle with ACT.
b) In direct support – 165 Field Regiment.
c) In support – 7 Artillery Brigade less 165 Field Regiment, one battery 66 Field Regiment
and 82 Light Regiment.
Brigadier Ferris had no time for reconnaissance. His appreciation was, therefore, based on a
general study of the area and perusal of maps, including the one captured from a Pakistani.
Finally, he decided to secure Barka Kalan. The causeway and the Bailey Bridge, 200 yards to
the West of Hudiara, became operational by 1545 hours on 07 September. Soon after, 9
MADRAS with B Squadron Central India Horse advanced to capture Barka Kalan and secured
it by 1800 hours despite heavy firing from the village. A half-hearted counter-attack launched by
Pakistani troops was beaten back.
North of the road, the 16 PUNJAB Patrols were subjected to firing from the Barka Khurd
village. On 08 September 65 Infantry Brigade decided to capture it and the task was entrusted to
16 PUNJAB. The Battalion launched the attack at 2030 hours on 09 September and captured
Barka Khurd by 2100 hours, without suffering any casualty.
7 Infantry Division maintained relentless pressure on the Pakistani defenders and advanced
further to capture Barki on its way to the Ichhogil Canal. The task was entrusted to 65 Infantry
Brigade, which decided to complete it in two Phases.
Phase I: 4 SIKH to capture the Barki Village
Phase II: 16 PUNJAB to capture the East Bank of Ichhogil and destroy the Barki Bridge
Central India Horse less one Squadron and 7 Artillery Brigade with 5 Field Regiment less one
Battery, 66 Field Regiment and 82 Light Regiment were to support the attack. 'H' hour was fixed
at 2000 hours on 10 September 1965.
There were three approaches to the Barki village - left, right and frontal. The left approach was
ruled out for an attack as it lay across flooded paddy fields, lacked any cover, and was
dominated by the high Canal bank to the South of the road. The frontal approach lay along the
road and to the North of it and provided for better going, although the ground was slightlyundulating and without cover. But it was a shorter route and the movement through it was
defiladed from enemy weapons, located on the Canal bank.
The right approach had a better going, but it involved a long detour from the Brigade's firm
base. Further, it was on an unprotected flank, exposed to firing from the weapons located on the
Canal bank, to the north of the road. The Brigade, therefore, preferred a frontal approach for the
attack.
As the Pakistanis were occupying prepared defences and were sure to respond with heavy
artillery and mortar shelling and the Indians had to pass through an approach, which was bereft
of any cover, a night attack was decided upon.
Prior to the launching of the attack by 4 SIKH, Indian guns engaged known Pakistani positions
from 1930 hours to 1955 hours. From 1955 hours to 2000 hours, the positions at Barki and along
the East Bank of the Canal were neutralised. At 2000 hours, the Division artillery, including 5
Field Regiment, effectively engaged Barki village and covered the advance of 4 SIKH. When
the assaulting troops neared the objective, Central India Horse less two Squadrons moved
forward to provide fire support to them. In the moonlit night, the Indian armour sprayed the
Canal bank and the village with fire, effectively. When Naib Subedar (then Havildar) Ajmer
Singh found his Platoon pinned down by the rapid Medium Machine Gun fire of the enemy.
With great presence of mind, he crawled towards the enemy bunker and although he was hit by
a burst, he continued to advance. Inspired by his personal example his platoon rushed forward
and destroyed the enemy position completely.
The leadership and courage displayed by Naib Subedar Ajmer Singh in this action were in the
best traditions of the Indian Army
4 SIKH captured Barki village after overcoming all resistance by 2110 hours. The defenders,
lodged in pill boxes, were either killed or captured. According to GOC, 7 Infantry Division,
continuous firing by the Indian armour at night, led Pakistanis to believe that the Indians had
brought in new tanks with night vision, and hence they abandoned Barki out of fear. ""It is said
that the Pakistanis took away 4 truck-loads of corpses from the battlefield of Barki. The dead
included Maj Aziz Bhatti, who was awarded the Nishan-i-Haider, the highest gallantry award of
Pakistan, posthumously. In this battle 4 SIKH suffered three JCOs and 20 ORs killed and two
Officers, one JCO and 93 ORs wounded.","3339173 Naib Subedar Ajmer Singh, The Sikh Regiment

The RAJPUTANA RIFLES is the senior most Rifle Regiment of the Indian Army. Its first
battalion was raised in January 1775. The RAJPUTANA RIFLES has a long and glorious history.
The regiment took part in some of the bloodiest battles in many theatres of the world. During
World War II, the battalions of this regiment fought in every theatre in which the Indian Army was
involved. Three of them, the 1st, 4th and Medium Machine Gun Battalions fought in Eritrea in
North Africa and Italy as part of the famous 4th Indian Division, whose fighting record was one
of the finest in World War II. Post-independence the regiment took part in many battles and
operations including the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Congo. The RAJPUTANA RIFLES fought
gallantly in the 1965 and 1971 India Pakistan wars. The Regiment has also been part of the Counter
Insurgency operations. Furthermore, During the Kargil War, the 2 Rajputana Rifles displayed
exemplary valour and determination in Tololing.

The infiltration of the Gibraltar Force at various points across the 750-km long Cease-fire Line
and the International Border between Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir began on 05 August 1965.
It covered areas of Jammu, Punch and Uri in the west, Tithwal in the North-West, Guraiz in the
North and Kargil in the North-East. Initially, about 1,500 infiltrators crossed over in small batches,
and concentrated at selected points inside Kashmir to organise themselves into larger groups. They
were equipped with light automatic weapons and their aim, apart from sabotage, was to
indoctrinate the Kashmiris so that they could revolt against India.1 The period of the infiltration
campaign was characterised by intense, hectic activity throughout the J&K Theatre with special
emphasis in the Valley. The raiders and own forces marched and counter-marched all over the
inhospitable terrain in a vast grim game of hide and seek. Several times during the day the
1 The Indian-Pakistan War of 1965: A History. S.N. Prasad. U.P. Thapliyal (2011). Natraj Publishers and Ministry
of Defence, Government of Indiaopponents met, clashed and reeled apart in a series of bloody actions, weaving a confused pattern
hard to unravel.2
The second batch of infiltrators, comprising some 6000 men, was pushed into Jammu and Kashmir
in the third week of August. Taking into account the replacements for those who ""exfiltrated"", it
is estimated that on the whole, about 8,000 infiltrators participated in these operations. By the first
week of September 1965, a third batch of infiltrators, approximately 5,500 strong, was ready in
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent across the border due to the
counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.3 The plan failed with their early detection and lack
of support from the locals, who gave away their positions. In sheer desperation, Pakistan also
employed its artillery in support of guerrilla operations in the Chhamb area. India grasped the
criticality of the ongoing plan, repulsed the attacks and cut off the entry and exit points into the
Kashmir Valley. A quick and firm response by India took Pakistan by surprise and thwarted their
well laid out plans.
To ease Pakistan's pressure on Chhamb, India opened a second front in Sialkot Sector. It was
strategically a vital area and a threat to it was likely to hurt Pakistan most. Loss of Sialkot would
have made Pakistan's position in Chhamb untenable and therefore, any Indian move in that
direction would have created a great scare in Pakistan. On the other hand, it would have served the
Indian interest very well indeed. This second diversionary move was launched by I Corps, led by
Lieutenant General PO Dunn, on 08 September, 1965.

The Operations in Samba-Jammu-Sialkot Sector covered the area between the Ravi and the
Chenab Rivers, with the Indo-Pak border running close to the foothills in the East. The road-link
between J&K and the rest of India runs through a narrow stretch of the lower foothills, parallel to
the border. The International Border is 28 km from Jammu and 14 km from Sialkot, a major
Pakistani communication centre. Sialkot was connected with Lahore by rail via Wazirabad-
Gujranwala, and also via Pasrur-Narowal and Pakistani supplies to the Chhamb sector passed
through it. The Sialkot- Pasrur stretch of this railway line was a vital link in the Pakistani defence
system. Chawinda was a small town of strategic importance on the Sialkot- Pasrur railway line.
HQ I Corps under Lieutenant General PO Dunn had been located at Kaluchak (neař Jammu) by 04
September. Troops made available to the Corps included the following:a) 1 Armoured Division (Major General Rajinder Singh, MVC)
b) 6 Mountain Division (Major General SK Korla, DSO, MC)
c) 14 Infantry Division (Major General RK Ranjeet Singh)
d) 26 Infantry Division (Major General ML Thapan)
I Corps was assigned the task of securing area Pagowal (Bhagowal), Phillora (Phillaurah),
Chawinda, and the Cross Roads with a view to advancing towards the Marala-Ravi Link Canal,
and eventually to the line of Dhallewali-Wuhilam-Daska-Mandhali. The operation was code-
named 'Operation Nepaľ.
By last light on 07 September, I Corps had made all preparations to cross the International Border
on a frontage extending from Degh Nadi to Suchetgarh. All formations were deployed as per the
plan, except for 14 Infantry Division, as its 58 Infantry Brigade, deployed at Madhopur Road
Bridge and the Headworks, could not be relieved. 28 Infantry Brigade, which had been allocated
to 6 Mountain Division, also could not join as it was deeply involved in Chhamb Sector. At 2300
hours on the night of 07/08 September, 6 Mountain Division and 26 Infantry Division crossed the
International Border into Pakistan. 'Operation Nepal' was on the move.4

Charwa village, the objective assigned to 99 Mountain Brigade, was a built-up area. The Brigade
appreciating that assault on the village would be hazardous during the hours of darkness, selected

Haryana. He was enrolled into the 2 RAJPUTANA RIFLES on 16 June 1962. During the 1965
Indo-Pak War, Rifleman Mathan Singh was awarded the Vir Chakra for a gallantry of high
order in the best traditions of the Indian Army.
The Rajputana Rifles is the senior most Rifle Regiment of the Indian Army. Its first battalion
was raised in January 1775. The Rajputana Rifles has a long and glorious history. The
Regiment took part in some of the bloodiest battles in many theatres of the world. During World
War II, the battalions of this Regiment fought in every theatre in which the Indian Army was
involved. Three of them, the 1st, 4th and Medium Machine Gun Battalions fought in Eritrea in
North Africa and Italy as part of the famous 4th Indian Division, whose fighting record was
one of the finest in World War II. Post-independence the regiment took part in many battles
and operations including the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Congo. The Rajputana Rifles fought
gallantly in the 1965 and 1971 India Pakistan wars. During the Kargil War, the Rajputana Rifles
displayed exemplary valour and determination especially in the Tololing Operation. The 2 RAJ
RIF was conferred India’s first ‘Instant Unit","’ by General VP Malik, the then Chief of
the Army Staff.
The genesis of the Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of
contention between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state
of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our
frontiers with Pakistan have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off
resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India
to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed
Forces with commendable bravery and steely resilience, but always with great restraint to not
escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak war of 1965 was the second war fought between these two
bordering countries. While India was still recovering from the Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan
saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be
weak in terms of defence preparation. The war began on 24 April 1965, when the Pakistan
Army attacked Indian territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside
the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of
the Indo-Pak Border Agreement ,1960 and the international law as per the United Nations
Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation
Gibraltar.
Dera Baba Nanak is situated along the banks of the Ravi River, approximately 28 km to the
North West of Batala in India. On the opposite bank of the river lies the town of Jassar, located
about 14 km east of Narowal in Pakistan. There is a 150 m long road-cum-rail bridge over the
Ravi River at Dera Baba Nanak. This bridge and a portion of land on the Indian side of the
river have been under Pakistani control since the Indo-Pakistani Agreement of 1959,
constituting what is known as the ""Pak Enclave."" Conversely, there is also a small piece of
Indian territory situated on the Pakistani side of the river, forming an ""Indian Enclave."" One
significant consequence of this arrangement is that Pakistan has the capability to transporttroops to its Enclave on the Indian side of the river using the Dera Baba Nanak Bridge as
needed.
Pakistan held Dera Baba Nanak with 115 Infantry Brigade, 30 Cavalry. One Battalion, 3 Punjab
(Pak), was in the Pakistani Enclave. However, the Indian assessment at that time differed from
the actual Pakistani deployments. According to the Indian assessment, Pakistan had positioned
one infantry Battalion, along with one Field Artillery Battery and a Squadron of tanks, in the
Narowal-Jassar area. Additionally, they believed that only two Pakistani Companies would be
present in the Pakistani Enclave on the Indian side of the Ravi River.
29 Infantry Brigade from 7 Infantry Division, consisting 2 RAJPUTANA RIFLES, 1/5
GORKHA RIFLES, and 2 MADRAS was operationally responsible for this area . Starting from
21 August 1965, it was put on a four-hour notice status at Ambala for potential operations in
the Dera Baba Nanak area.
In the spring of 1965, during the conflict between India and Pakistan, the 2nd RAJPUTANA
RIFLES were deployed to defend a significant area near Dera Baba Nanak, which included the
Northern part of the Jassar rail-road Bridge on the Ravi River spanning about 4000 yards. On
a critical night in September 1965, the Southern end of the Bridge, held by the 1/5 GORKHA
RIFLES, was taken over by enemy forces, prompting orders from the Corps Commander
Lieutenant General JS Dhillon for the 2nd RAJPUTANA RIFLES to reclaim that section
urgently to prevent further enemy advancement towards Dera Baba Nanak.
Rifleman Mathan Singh, serving as the light machine gunner in 'D' Company, played a pivotal
role in the Battalion's mission to recapture the Southern end of the Jassar Bridge. Despite strong
enemy opposition, by the morning of 07 September, the Bridge was retaken. The enemy,
however, having blown up a section of the Bridge, began regrouping for a counter-attack. In a
display of extraordinary courage, Mathan Singh and his fellow soldiers from 'D' Company,
disregarding personal safety, crawled to the far end of the bridge. There, in broad daylight, they
effectively engaged the enemy with Machine Gun fire for nearly thirty minutes, thwarting the
impending counter-attack. Thanks to their determination, the enemy's efforts were foiled even
before they could launch the assault. After the enemy withdrew and 'D' Company personnel
reached the far end of the Bridge, they found Mathan Singh, who had succumbed to seven
gunshot wounds, still holding his Light Machine Gun.
Rifleman Mathan Singh's exceptional bravery and unwavering determination went above and
beyond the expected duties, leading to the posthumous award of the Vir Chakra in recognition
of his extraordinary valour.CITATION

(Effective date of award– 6th September 1965)
On the night of the 6th/7th September 1965, during a counterattack on the enemy on the bridge
over the river Ravi near Dera Baba Nanak on the India-Pakistan border, Rifleman Mathan
Singh was the leader of an LMG unit in one of the sections of Rajputana Rifles. After the
battalion had captured its objective, the portion which Rifleman Mathan Singh's section was
holding was severely counter-attacked by the enemy. Rifleman Mathan Singh bore the brunt
of this attack and kept the enemy at bay. He was severely wounded, but did not leave his gun.
When the enemy force attacked again, Rifleman Mathan Singh prevented it from advancing.
Meanwhile, the position of our troops on the objective ha been consolidated. When the enemy
force gave up further attempts to recapture it, Rifleman Mathan Singh was found dead with his
gun still to his shoulder.
By his supreme sacrifice, Rifleman Mathan Singh enabled his company to hold on to
its objective. In this action, he displayed gallantry of very high order in the best traditions of
the Indian Army.

The Corps of Army Air Defence traces its origins to 1939, in Pre-Independent India when Anti-
aircraft units were raised to counter Japanese air threat during World War-II. In its true sense, the
raising of the Corps of Army Air Defence began on 15 September 1940 when Number 1 Anti-
Aircraft Training Centre commenced its raising in Colaba (Mumbai) and was completed by
January 1941 in Karachi. Post-independence, it remained a part of the Regiment of Artillery and
later bifurcated as a separate arm on 10 January 1994, carving out a niche for itself as an
operational critical and technical advanced Combat Support Arm of the Indian Army. The corps
enjoyed autonomous status from 1994, after the bifurcation of the Corps of Air Defence Artillery
from the Army's Regiment of Artillery.1 A separate training school, the Army Air Defence College
(AADC), was established to train its personnel.2 On 1 November 1989, the Air Defence & Guided
Missile School and Centre was formally inaugurated as a part of Gopalpur military Cantonment.
The 'Air Defence & Guided Missile School and Centre' was rechristened as 'Army Air Defence
College' (AADC) in 1998. Later in 2008, the Army Air Defence Centre was also relocated to Army
Air Defence College. The motto of Army Air Defence is ""Aksshe Shatrun Jahi"" meaning ‘Shoot
the Enemy in Air’. The glorious history of the Corps is adorned by numerous honours and awards.
It includes four Battle Honours, four Military Crosses, two Orders of the British Empire, one Medal
of the British Empire, seven Indian Distinguished, Service Medals and two Ashok Chakras.

The infiltration of the Gibraltar Force at various points across the 750-km long Cease-fire Line
and the International Border between Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir began on 05 August 1965.
It covered areas of Jammu, Punch and Uri in the West, Tithwal in the North-West, Guraiz in the
North and Kargil in the North-East. Initially, about 1,500 infiltrators crossed over in small batches,
and concentrated at selected points inside Kashmir to organise themselves into larger groups. They
were equipped with light automatic weapons and their aim, apart from sabotage, was to
indoctrinate the Kashmiris so that they could revolt against India.3 The period of the infiltration
campaign was characterised by intense, hectic activity throughout the J&K Theatre with special
emphasis in the Valley. The raiders and own forces marched and counter-marched all over the

The second batch of infiltrators, comprising some 6000 men, was pushed into Jammu and Kashmir
in the third week of August. Taking into account the replacements for those who ""exfiltrated"", it
is estimated that on the whole, about 8,000 infiltrators participated in these operations. By the first
week of September 1965, a third batch of infiltrators, approximately 5,500 strong, was ready in
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent across the border due to the

of support from the locals, who gave away their positions.
In sheer desperation, Pakistan also employed its artillery in support of guerrilla operations in the
Chhamb area. India grasped the criticality of the ongoing plan, repulsed the attacks and cut off the
entry and exit points into the Kashmir Valley. A quick and firm response by India took Pakistan
by surprise and thwarted their well laid out plans. India reacted almost immediately by recapturing
Kargil heights which had been returned in Jul 1965, a limited offensive in the Tithwal Sector and
most importantly, the capture of Haji Pir Pass in a daring operation by 1 PARA by Major (later
Lieutenant General) Ranjit Singh Dayal under 68 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier (later
Lieutenant General) ZC Bakshi on 28 August 1965. This was one of the most notable
achievements of the riposte. The capture of Haji Pir and loss of key positions in the Kishenganga
Bulge were a severe setback for the Pakistanis which put them in a state of shock. Thus, by the
end of August 1965, Pakistan’s plans for quick annexation of the Valley had been squarely
defeated.
The failure of Operation Gibraltar saw the last Phase, Operation Grand Slam put into effect by
General Ayub Khan on 01 September 1965. A massive attack was planned in the Chhamb-Jaurian
Sector aimed at capturing Akhnur, which would sever communications and cut off supply routes
to Indian troops. In desperation, Pakistan played its hand by launching Operation ‘Grand Slam’ on
01 September 1965. It was launched across the Southern most portion of the CFL and was aimed
at Akhnur; thus, Pakistan aimed at cutting of Indian positions in Naushera, Rajauri and Punch.
Thereafter, as a part of Operation Grand Slam, an armoured thrust could be developed towards
Jammu, the capture of which would have severed all land communications to Jammu & Kashmir.6
This would place Pakistan in a position to dictate terms to India.
Pakistan did not call off Operation ‘Grand Slam' despite the security council's call for an immediate
cease-fire on 4 September 1965. It even carried out an air raid on Amritsar the next day. The Indian
warning that an attack against Jammu and Kashmir would be treated as an attack against India was
also ignored by Pakistan. Meanwhile, apprehending a Pakistani attack, India had also formulated
a contingency plan to meet the situation militarily. The Indian plan visualised a limited offensive
intended to cover the area from Dera Baba Nanak in the north to the Sutlej in the south.

The objective of the retaliatory Indian plan was to threaten Lahore, drive a wedge between the
Pakistani forces deployed in the Lahore and Sialkot sectors and destroy their war potential. The
offensive was to serve the dual purpose of ensuring the security of Punjab by advancing the Indian
defence line to the Ichhogil Canal and to capture some Pakistani territory to serve as a bargaining
lever in the political parleys, on the conclusion of hostilities.
In view of the above plan, the XI Corps was assigned the tasks on August 1965 to destroy the
enemy forces which might enter Punjab and Ganganagar Sector in Rajasthan. Also, on orders from
GOC-in-C Western Command, the Corps was to undertake the following measures
simultaneously:
a. To advance to the Ichhogil Canal along the axes GT road, Bhikkiwind-Khalra and
Bhikkiwind-Khem Karan, to secure Pakistani territory from opposite Ranian inclusive toits junction with Dipalpur Canal opposite Hussainiwala. Also to capture intact Ichhogil
Uttar road bridge, GT road bridge, Jallo road bridge and Barki bridge on Ichhogil Canal
b. To eliminate the Pakistani bridge-head at the Dera Baba Nanak and if possible, capture the
bridge on the Ravi River, intact.
The Pakistan Air Force had formulated a perfect war plan against India by 29 June 1965. It
envisaged a surprise attack on major IAF bases to destroy as many planes as possible on the ground
and thus blunt the Indian edge in numbers Even the timing of attack against IAF bases was
carefully considered, and a strike at dusk was preferred. After a surprise strike by the Sabres, the
bombers based at Mauripur were to rain bombs over the IAF bases the whole night. Even training
aircraft were to be used in operations against the cities of Punjab, from the very first night of the
War. Some Sabre jets were earmarked to lend close support to the Pakistan Army. Thus, the
beginning of an all-out war on 06 September might have surprised the Pakistan Army but not the
Pakistan Air Force.
A desperate Pakistan Army mounted a major armour-cum-infantry thrust in Chhamb, on 01
September 1965. The objective was to capture Akhnur Bridge and cut off the Jammu- Punch road.
The same day at 1600 hours General JN Chaudhuri and Air Marshal Arjan Singh, met Defence
Minister Chavan and Defence Secretary PVR Rao and sought permission to use the Indian Air
Force (IAF) against the invaders. A 'Go Ahead’ was obtained and within an hour the IAF went
into action to stem the onslaught.
In a Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting held at 8.30 AM on 06 September, and presided over by
President Ayub Khan, the Pakistan Air Force Chief, Air Vice Marshal Nur Khan, was given full
authority to conduct air operations the way he liked. He planned a pre-emptive attack on selected
Indian Air Force bases to neutralise IAF aircraft and installations, and also to allot part of the
Pakistan Air Force for close-support operations and air defence. One of these targets was Halwara,
situated South West of Ludhiana Punjab. Four F-86s of PAF attacked the Halwara base at 1840
hrs. At that time, IAF had two Hunter Squadrons, Nos 7 and 27 Squadrons stationed at Halwara
of which No. 7 Squadron had moved to Halwara from Ambala in August. Halwara was better
prepared to take on the PAF raid as it had been flying Combat Air Patrols (CAP) regularly since
the second half of August.7

Kishan Singh Narula. Captain Narula was Commissioned into 6/5 GORKHA RIFLES of the
Indian Army on 12 June 1960 at the age of 22. During 1965 Indo Pak War, he was deployed in

Pakistani infiltrators from approaching Balwinder Suspension Bridge. During the action, he
displayed outstanding leadership and endurance and kept repulsing enemy attacks from 12 August

The first Battalion of Gurkha Regiment (now Gorkha Rifles) was raised in 1815 during the Anglo-
Nepalese war. Impressed by the qualities displayed by Gurkhas during the War, the British started
active recruitment of Gurkhas into the British Indian army. After the partition, in 1947 six Gurkha
regiments viz, 1 GR, 3 GR, 4 GR, 5 GR, 8 GR and 9 GR remained with the Indian Army, while 2
GR, 6 GR, 7 GR and 10 GR were transferred to British Army as part of the Tripartite Agreement
signed between India, Nepal and Britain. The 5 GORKHA RIFLES (Frontier Force) was formed
in 1858 as part of the British Indian Army and served in the First World War and Second World
War. The Regiment was formerly known as the 5th Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force). The
Regiment’s motto is “Shaurya Evam Nistha” (Courage and Determination). Since 1947, the
Regiment has proved its mettle in number of conflicts, including the Indo Pak War of 1965 and
1971. It has also participated in the Peacekeeping Operations in Sri Lanka. The Regiment’s present
headquarter is at Shillong in North Eastern India. There were seven Victoria Crosses awarded to

counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.3

The infiltrators initially worked in small groups independently. Subsequently, in the hope of better
results, they changed their tactics and started concentrating in selected areas in larger groups. Some
infiltrators exfiltrated without participating in any operation, while some others kept drifting till,
they ran into another group and merged with it. During the later phase of the operations, they were
able to establish strongholds in some areas, mostly isolated mountainous regions. Though the
Gibraltar Force succeeded in tying down a large number of the Indian security forces, it failed toengineer an uprising in the State. The Force did succeed in committing some acts of sabotage and
violence, but it generally failed to achieve the objectives.
In the Kalidhar-Samba Sector, the Babar Force, comprising 400 men, entered the State through
Bhimber, Sadabad, Penga and Kalidhar with a view to spreading out in the Naushera-Sunderbani
area. On 09 August, 150 infiltrators were sighted at Banjaro, North of Chhamb, and by 12 August,
300 of them had established a camp in Narijira and Panapura. 200 infiltrators who had penetrated
Kalidhar were engaged by the Indian security forces and suffered heavy casualties. Soon by the
middle of August, the infiltrators were forced to retreat back to Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK).
A group of infiltrators based in Shakargarh area of Pakistan raided Samba in Jammu with a view
to disrupt the communication between Pathankot and Jammu.
In the Chhamb Sector, 300 to 400 infiltrators were reported in area NW 4878 and a Company of
6/5 GORKHA RIFLES was sent to deal with them. When the information was received that the
Kalidhar - Balwinder track was dominated by infiltrators. 6/5 GORKHA RIFLES was given the
responsibility to reopen this route.4
On 12 August 1965, on receiving the information, Captain Arjan Singh Narula of 6/5 GORKHA
RIFLES led a Company of his Battalion to Kalidhar in Jammu and Kashmir, to assist a Company
of JAK Rifles and to prevent infiltrators from approaching Balwinder Suspension Bridge, which
was the only link with the rest of the theatre. He arrived in the evening and launched an attack the
same night and cleared two points held by the enemy.
On the morning of 14 August, patrol was ambushed by the enemy. On hearing this, Captain Narula
rushed a Platoon and himself followed with the other two Platoons. Although the Company was
short of ammunition, especially for 2-inch Mortars and Light Machine Guns, Captain Narula
launched an attack killing 20 infiltrators and a large number fled. That evening and the next night
Captain Narula's positions were heavily shelled but the attacks were successfully repulsed. By 16
August his men were so exhausted that they could hardly move. Although exhausted himself, he
collected a Section of volunteers and reached the picquets where he managed to get some water
for his men. This action encouraged his men and they continued to repulse enemy attacks on 17,
18 and 19 August until the Battalion joined them.
Throughout this operation from 12 August to 20 August 1965, Captain Arjun Singh Narula
displayed outstanding leadership, courage and endurance. He was awarded Vir Chakra for his
gallantry.

in Mahendragarh, Haryana. He was enrolled into the 18 RAJPUTANA RIFLES on 20 May
1958. During the 1965 Indo- Pak War, Naik Jagdish Singh was awarded the Vir Chakra for
conspicuous bravery and courage.
The RAJPUTANA RIFLES is the senior most Rifle Regiment of the Indian Army. Its first
Battalion was raised in January 1775. The RAJPUTANA RIFLES has a long and glorious
history. The Regiment took part in some of the bloodiest battles in many theatres of the world.
During World War II, the Battalions of this Regiment fought in every theatre in which the
Indian Army was involved. Three of them, the 1st, 4th and Medium Machine Gun Battalions
fought in Eritrea in North Africa and Italy as part of the famous 4th Indian Division, whose
fighting record was one of the finest in World War II. Post-Independence the Regiment took
part in many battles and operations including the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Congo. The
Rajputana Rifles fought gallantly in the 1965 and 1971 India Pakistan wars. During the 1965
Indo-Pak war, the RAJPUTANA RIFLES displayed exemplary valour and determination
especially in the Khem Karan Sector.
The genesis of the Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of
contention between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state
of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our
frontiers with Pakistan have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off
resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India
to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed
Forces with commendable bravery and steely resilience, but always with great restraint to not
escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak war of 1965 was the second war fought between these two
bordering countries. While India was still recovering from the Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan
saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be
weak in terms of defence preparation. The war began on 24 April 1965, when the Pakistan
Army attacked Indian territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside
the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of
the Indo-Pak Border Agreement ,1960 and the international law as per the United Nations
Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation
Gibraltar. The 1965 war was fought in various Sectors including in Khem Karan which was
the area of responsibility of 4 Infantry Division and 2 (Independent) Armoured Brigade.
Historians consider this to be the greatest tank battle since the Battle of Kursk, fought during
World War II– The Battle of Asal Uttar, a pivotal engagement in the 1965 India-Pakistan war,
unfolded from September 8 to September 10, 1965. Positioned near Khem Karan, the Indian
resistance played a crucial role in shifting the balance of power in India's favour during the
conflict. The Pakistani Army's Battle Group, composed of the 1st Armoured Division and 11
Infantry Division, had crossed the International Border and captured the Indian town of Khem
Karan.
Recognizing the seriousness of the situation, the Major General Gurbaksh Singh, General
Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 4 Mountain Division ordered the Division to withdraw andestablish a ""Horse Shoe"" shaped defensive position centred on Asal Uttar. Three Indian Army
units, namely the 18 RAJPUTANA RIFLES, 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES, and 4 GRENADIERS,
were strategically positioned to cover three axes leading to Khem Karan, providing depth to
the 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES. The 9 JAK RIFLES were deployed in the rear, while the Deccan
Horse commanded by Lieutenant Colonel (later General) AS Vaidya, was positioned ahead, to
the South East of the Division's defences. In a well-executed tactical manoeuvre, Indian troops
breached the Rohi canal at night, flooding the sugarcane fields. When morning came, the M-
47 and M-48 Patton tanks of the 1st Armoured Division of Pakistan were lured into the horse-
shoe shaped defensive position with the intention of overwhelming Indian defences. However,
the swampy terrain slowed down the advance of the Pakistani tanks, which ultimately became
immobilized in the muddy slush.
With the Pakistani M-47 and M-48 Patton tanks approaching within 900 meters of the main
defences, the Deccan Horse, equipped with Shermans, engaged them effectively and destroyed
eleven Pakistani tanks.
A ceasefire agreement was signed by the two countries and it was effected by 1530 hrs on 23
September. But before that on 21 September, A Company was assigned the task to eliminate
an enemy position in the Khem Karan Sector. Naik Jagdish Singh, serving as a Section
Commander in a Company tasked with eliminating an enemy position in the Khem Karan
Sector on September 21, 1965, faced a challenging situation. The enemy's position was fortified
with a strong infantry platoon, supported by tanks and anti-tank guns. When our infantry assault
began, it became evident that the enemy had manned tanks in their positions. Naik Jagdish
Singh was assigned the task of destroying these tanks using Strim grenades. He demonstrated
remarkable skill by manoeuvring around the first tank he encountered, positioning himself
strategically, and successfully eliminating it. As the enemy retaliated with artillery and tank
fire, Naik Jagdish Singh fearlessly advanced and destroyed a second tank. Undeterred, he
moved towards a third tank but tragically lost his life due to Machine Gun fire from a Browning
Machine. Throughout this action, Naik Jagdish Singh displayed exceptional courage and
unwavering dedication to duty, upholding the highest traditions of the Army.","Naik Jagdish Singh, 18 Rajputana Rifles

Naik Jagdish Singh was Section Commander in a Company which was assigned the task of
eliminating an enemy position in the Khem Karan sector on 21 September 1965. This
position was held by a strong infantry platoon and was well supported by a troop of tanks,
and anti-tank guns. Just as our own infantry assault went in, it was discovered that there were
manned tanks in the enemy locality. Naik Jagdish Singh was given the task of destroying
these tanks with Strim grenades. He skilfully moved around the first encountered tank and
positioned himself advantageously and destroyed the tank. By now the enemy had started
bringing down battery fire from a covering tank, and artillery fire. Regardless of his personal
safety, Naik Jagdish Singh moved forward and with his Strim grenades destroyed the second
tank. With determination, he now moved to destroy a third tank, but was killed by a burst
from a Browning Machine. In this action, Naik Jagdish Singh displayed high courage and
devotion to duty in the best traditions of the Army.

in Punjab. His father’s name was Basant Singh. Naik Bachittar Singh was enrolled into 1
GUARDS of the Indian Army on 14 December 1949 at the age of 21. During 1965 Indo Pak War,
he was deployed in Kargil Sector of Jammu and Kashmir, to stop the Pakistani encroachers in the
case of any violation. During the action, he displayed conspicuous courage and initiative and
destroyed an enemy post completely but in order to do so sacrificed himself for the nation.
The Brigade of The Guards is a regiment of the Indian Army. The troops from all parts of the
country serve in various battalions of this regiment. The regiment was formed in 1949 as the first
mixed class Indian regiment by Field Marshal KM Cariappa OBE. The Brigade of GUARDS was
raised to implement the government’s policy of encouraging army recruitment from regions under-
represented in the forces. Three of Army’s oldest battalions - 2 PUNJAB, 1 GRENADIERS, and
1 RAJ RIF were converted as the GUARDS battalions in 1949. Though the Brigade of Guards is
only 50 years old, its constituent battalions go back as far as 225 years. They also share 93 Battle
Honours earned around the world. 1 GUARDS was originally 2 PUNJAB. At the moment, the
Regiment consists of 19 battalions. The majority of these operate as mechanised infantry. During
the first war of Kashmir 1 RAJPUT (4 GUARDS) showed their mettle in the battle of Taindhar,
where Naik Jadunath Singh fought valiantly and won the first Param Vir Chakra for his regiment.
During the 1971Indo-Pak War, the regiment earned its second Param Vir Chakra through Lance
Naik Albert Ekka of 14 GUARDS for heroism in Gangasagar theatre.
The 1965 Indo-Pak War marked the second conflict between the neighbouring nations. India, still
reeling from the aftermath of the 1962 Sino-Indian war, found itself targeted by Pakistan, which
viewed the situation as an opportune moment to seize Jammu and Kashmir, presuming India to be
weak in terms of defence preparation. The war initiated on 24 April 1965, when Pakistan Army,

The infiltration of the Gibraltar Force at various points across the 750-km long Cease-fire Line
and the international border between Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir covered areas of Jammu,
Punch and Uri in the west, Tithwal in the North-West, Guraiz in the North and Kargil in the North-
East. Initially, about 1,500 infiltrators crossed over in small batches, and concentrated at selectedpoints inside Kashmir to organise themselves into larger groups. They were equipped with light
automatic weapons and their aim, apart from sabotage, was to indoctrinate the Kashmiris so that
they could revolt against India.1 The period of the infiltration campaign was characterised by
intense, hectic activity throughout the J&K Theatre with special emphasis in the Valley. The
raiders and own forces marched and counter-marched all over the inhospitable terrain in a vast
grim game of hide and seek. Several times during the day the opponents met, clashed and reeled
apart in a series of bloody actions, weaving a confused pattern hard to unravel.2
In view of the alarming increase in cease-fire violations by Pakistan, the Indian Army chose not to
remain passive any longer. It decided to inflict maximum casualties on the encroachers in the event
of any violation. There were Pakistani posts on the heights in Kargil area, commanding the vital
Srinagar-Leh Road, which constituted the main supply route for the Indian troops in Ladakh. The
Kargil region falls between the Ladakh Range in the North-East and the Great Himalayan Range
in the South-West. The Pakistani defences at Pt 13620 dominated the Indian positions, including
the Brigade HQ at Kargil. On 16 May, the Pakistanis attacked one of the Indian posts in strength.
The attack was repulsed, but the threat persisted. The two Recce Patrols sent by 4 RAJPUT to
Point 13620 and Black Rocks discovered that the Pakistani troops (Company supported by MMGs
and 3-Inch Mortars) occupying Point 13620, Saddle, Black Rocks, Peak 1 and Peak 2, had
committed encroachment into Indian territory. Indian 121 (Independent) Infantry Brigade Group
(4 RAJPUT, 1 JAK and 17 PUNJAB) and 1 GUARDS (ex 3 Infantry Division) held this area in
strength. Two Companies of 12 JAK and 85 Light Regiment were also in support.
The enemy had occupied Kala Pahar, a 2700-meter-long feature, dominating the road about 10 km
West of Kargil. This was discovered by a Patrol of 1 JAK MILITIA on 29 May. A complaint was
lodged and Pakistani troops were asked to vacate the area by the UN. As the UN effort failed to
get the aggression vacated, India decided to use force. 1 GUARDS was entrusted with the task of
capturing Kala Pahar. Recce patrols of 1 JAK MILITIA reported that the enemy strength at Kala
Pahar was about 200 men, and that the terrain was steep and not easily negotiable even by day,
and that Pakistani troops had obtained reinforcements. It was decided to attack Kala Pahar from
the Right Ridge. Major MCS Menon, Officiating Commanding Officer 1 GUARDS, was ordered
to establish a firm base with one Company in area Right Ridge on 01 June, move the entire
Battalion there by 03 June and secure a suitable forming up place. Gunners were to register targets
and carry out harassing fire for two-three days. The 'H' hour was fixed at 0230 hours on 05 June
1965.

hazardous climb of 1,200 m from Harka Bahadur Bridge. A Company of 1 GUARDS succeeded
in establishing a firm base there by 0800 hrs on 02 June, after a brief encounter with a Pakistani
patrol. Pakistanis started shelling the base area and also made a move to occupy area known as 3
Bumps, a feature which dominated the proposed Forming Up Place. Captain RS Saharawat led a
Section through the shelling and secured Three Bumps, before the enemy could do so.
For two days and nights prior to the D-day, the intruders were subjected to harassing fire by 85
Light Regiment. 57mm RCL guns, which had been carried by men to the firm base, were also
successfully employed to destroy their 'sangars' before last light on 04 June. The Battalion moved
to the Forming Up Place at 0130 hours on 05 June and the attack was launched at 0230 hours. 1
GUARDS braving heavy small arms fire, and fighting from bunker to bunker, captured Kala Pahar
by 0500 hours on 05 June. Continuing the attack, they also captured OP Ridge by 1030 hours, after
inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.
Naik Bachittar Singh, who was the Commander of the leading Section of 1 GUARDS, was leading
his Section to capture a Pakistani Post. When his Platoon was about 100 yards from the objective,
it was held up by enemy Light Machine Gun and Medium Machine Gun fire. With great courage,
Despite being wounded by enemy fire, Naik Singh charged towards the enemy. Undeterred, he
crawled towards the enemy Post, threw grenades into it and kept firing till the enemy retreated and
vacated the Post. The retreating enemy continued firing. Naik Bachittar Singh returned the fire and
killed two of them before he was hit in the head by a burst of Light Machine Gun fire and was
killed. But before sacrificing himself, by his act of bravery, he had cleared the enemy Post
completely and the feature was captured without any further enemy opposition.
The courage and initiative displayed by Naik Bachittar Singh throughout the action was in the best
traditions of the Indian Army. He was awarded Vir Chakra posthumously.","2435469, Naik Bachittar Singh, 1 GUARDS.

The Corps of Army Air Defence traces its origins to 1939, in Pre-Independent India when Anti-
aircraft units were raised to counter Japanese air threat during World War-II. In its true sense, the
raising of the Corps of Army Air Defence began on 15 September 1940 when Number 1 Anti-
Aircraft Training Centre commenced its raising in Colaba (Mumbai) and was completed by
January 1941 in Karachi. Post-independence, it remained a part of the Regiment of Artillery and
later bifurcated as a separate arm on 10 January 1994, carving out a niche for itself as an
operational critical and technical advanced Combat Support Arm of the Indian Army. The corps
enjoyed autonomous status from 1994, after the bifurcation of the Corps of Air Defence Artillery
from the Army's Regiment of Artillery.1 A separate training school, the Army Air Defence College
(AADC), was established to train its personnel.2 On 1 November 1989, the Air Defence & Guided
Missile School and Centre was formally inaugurated as a part of Gopalpur military Cantonment.
The 'Air Defence & Guided Missile School and Centre' was rechristened as 'Army Air Defence
College' (AADC) in 1998. Later in 2008, the Army Air Defence Centre was also relocated to Army
Air Defence College. The motto of Army Air Defence is ""Aksshe Shatrun Jahi"" meaning ‘Shoot

The second batch of infiltrators, comprising some 6000 men, was pushed into Jammu and Kashmir
in the third week of August. Taking into account the replacements for those who ""exfiltrated"", it
is estimated that on the whole, about 8,000 infiltrators participated in these operations. By the first
week of September 1965, a third batch of infiltrators, approximately 5,500 strong, was ready in
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent across the border due to the
counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.5 The plan failed with their early detection and lack
of support from the locals, who gave away their positions.
5 The Indian-Pakistan War of 1965: A History. S.N. Prasad. U.P. Thapliyal (2011). Natraj Publishers and Ministry
of Defence, Government of IndiaIn sheer desperation, Pakistan also employed its artillery in support of guerrilla operations in the
Chhamb area. India grasped the criticality of the ongoing plan, repulsed the attacks and cut off the
entry and exit points into the Kashmir Valley. A quick and firm response by India took Pakistan
by surprise and thwarted their well laid out plans. India reacted almost immediately by recapturing
Kargil heights which had been returned in Jul 1965, a limited offensive in the Tithwal Sector and
most importantly, the capture of Haji Pir Pass in a daring operation by 1 PARA by Major (later
Lieutenant General) Ranjit Singh Dayal under 68 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier (later
Lieutenant General) ZC Bakshi on 28 August 1965. This was one of the most notable
achievements of the riposte. The capture of Haji Pir and loss of key positions in the Kishenganga
Bulge were a severe setback for the Pakistanis which put them in a state of shock. Thus, by the
end of August 1965, Pakistan’s plans for quick annexation of the Valley had been squarely
defeated.
The failure of Operation Gibraltar saw the last Phase, Operation Grand Slam put into effect by
General Ayub Khan on 01 September 1965. A massive attack was planned in the Chhamb-Jaurian
Sector aimed at capturing Akhnur, which would sever communications and cut off supply routes
to Indian troops. In desperation, Pakistan played its hand by launching Operation ‘Grand Slam’ on
01 September 1965. It was launched across the Southern most portion of the CFL and was aimed
at Akhnur; thus, Pakistan aimed at cutting of Indian positions in Naushera, Rajauri and Punch.
Thereafter, as a part of Operation Grand Slam, an armoured thrust could be developed towards
Jammu, the capture of which would have severed all land communications to Jammu & Kashmir.6
This would place Pakistan in a position to dictate terms to India.
Pakistan did not call off Operation ‘Grand Slam' despite the security council's call for an immediate
cease-fire on 4 September 1965. It even carried out an air raid on Amritsar the next day. The Indian
warning that an attack against Jammu and Kashmir would be treated as an attack against India was
also ignored by Pakistan. Meanwhile, apprehending a Pakistani attack, India had also formulated
a contingency plan to meet the situation militarily. The Indian plan visualised a limited offensive
intended to cover the area from Dera Baba Nanak in the north to the Sutlej in the south.

The objective of the retaliatory Indian plan was to threaten Lahore, drive a wedge between the
Pakistani forces deployed in the Lahore and Sialkot sectors and destroy their war potential. The
offensive was to serve the dual purpose of ensuring the security of Punjab by advancing the Indian
defence line to the Ichhogil Canal and to capture some Pakistani territory to serve as a bargaining
lever in the political parleys, on the conclusion of hostilities.
In view of the above plan, the XI Corps was assigned the tasks on August 1965 to destroy the
enemy forces which might enter Punjab and Ganganagar Sector in Rajasthan. Also, on orders from
GOC-in-C Western Command, the Corps was to undertake the following measures
simultaneously:
a. To advance to the Ichhogil Canal along the axes GT road, Bhikkiwind-Khalra and
Bhikkiwind-Khem Karan, to secure Pakistani territory from opposite Ranian inclusive to
its junction with Dipalpur Canal opposite Hussainiwala. Also to capture intact Ichhogil
Uttar road bridge, GT road bridge, Jallo road bridge and Barki bridge on Ichhogil Canalb. To eliminate the Pakistani bridge-head at the Dera Baba Nanak and if possible, capture the
bridge on the Ravi River, intact.
The Pakistan Air Force had formulated a perfect war plan against India by 29 June 1965. It
envisaged a surprise attack on major IAF bases to destroy as many planes as possible on the ground
and thus blunt the Indian edge in numbers Even the timing of attack against IAF bases was
carefully considered, and a strike at dusk was preferred. After a surprise strike by the Sabres, the
bombers based at Mauripur were to rain bombs over the IAF bases the whole night. Even training
aircraft were to be used in operations against the cities of Punjab, from the very first night of the
War. Some Sabre jets were earmarked to lend close support to the Pakistan Army. Thus, the
beginning of an all-out war on 06 September might have surprised the Pakistan Army but not the
Pakistan Air Force.
A desperate Pakistan Army mounted a major armour-cum-infantry thrust in Chhamb, on 01
September 1965. The objective was to capture Akhnur Bridge and cut off the Jammu- Punch road.
The same day at 1600 hours General JN Chaudhuri and Air Marshal Arjan Singh, met Defence
Minister Chavan and Defence Secretary PVR Rao and sought permission to use the Indian Air
Force (IAF) against the invaders. A 'Go Ahead’ was obtained and within an hour the IAF went
into action to stem the onslaught.
In a Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting held at 0830 hours on 06 September, and presided over by
President Ayub Khan, the Pakistan Air Force Chief, Air Vice Marshal Nur Khan, was given full
authority to conduct air operations the way he liked. He planned a pre-emptive attack on selected
Indian Air Force bases to neutralise IAF aircraft and installations, and also to allot part of the
Pakistan Air Force for close-support operations and air defence.
One of these targets was Kalaikunda air base situated near Kharagpur in West Bengal. The 1965
War was largely fought on the Western front and there was no ground action on the Eastern
border. But on 07 September 1965, Kalaikunda IAF base came under attack from PAF Sabre F-86
jets. Six Sabres wreaked havoc and by the time the Pakistani jets flew back to Tezgaon, four IAF
Vampires and two Canberras were damaged permanently. There was also significant damage to
the airfield.7 But there was hardly any respite for Kalaikunda. The Sabres returned to for their
second attack within a few hours. However, the second attack on Kalaikunda was such a disaster
for the PAF Sabres that they never ventured to attack Kalaikunda again for the rest of the 1965

4144088,PA/Naik,Ram Kumar,4 KUMAON,"PA/Naik Ram Kumar was born on 01 July 1938, in Kanina-Khas, Mahendargarh District
of Haryana. His father’s name was Gugan Ram. Among six sons of Gugan Ram, four joined
KUMAON Regiment and one joined Artillery.1 Naik Ram Kumar was enrolled into 4 KUMAON
on 06 September 1957 at the age of 19. In 1965 Indo Pak War, Naik Kumar was deployed in
Kupwara – Tithwal area. His task was to prevent Pakistani infiltrators from destroying Kralpur
Bridge. During the action, he displayed outstanding courage and determination in the face of the
enemy and laid his life for the nation.
The KUMAON Regiment traces its origins to the 18th century and has fought in every major
campaign of the British Indian Army and the Indian Army including the two world wars. During
World War I, a Kumaon battalion was raised at Ranikhet on 23 October 1917 as 34/39th Kumaon
Rifles. In 1918, it was redesigned as 1st battalion, 50th Kumaon Rifles and a second battalion was
raised. These were merged with Hyderabad contingent into the 19th Hyderabad Regiment in 1923.
On 27 October 1945, the 19th Hyderabad was renamed as 19 Kumaon Regiment. Post
Independence, it has been known as the Kumaon Regiment. Staying true to the Regimental motto
of Parakramo Vijayate (Valour Triumphs) the Regiment has proved its mettle in Indo-Pak War of
1947-48 where Major Somnath Sharma of 4 KUMAON was awarded the first Param Vir Chakra,
Sino-India War of 1962 where 13 KUMAON displayed conspicuous courage and undaunted
determination while fighting the enemy during the Battle of Rezang La, and Major Shaitan Singh
received the Param Vir Chakra, Indo- Pak War of 1965, Indo-Pak War 1971, Kargil War of 1999
and also participated in the Indian Peace-keeping Force in Sri Lanka. During the Sino-India War
of 1962,.2 The KUMAON Regiment has contributed three Chiefs to the Indian Army namely
General SM Shringesh, General KS Thimayya, DSO and General TN Raina, MVC.
The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and Indian frontiers with Pakistan have remained a
sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at
several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of
Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with commendable bravery and steely
resilience, but always with great restrain to not escalate the conflict The 1965 Indo-Pak War
marked the second conflict between the neighbouring nations. India, still reeling from the
aftermath of the 1962 Sino-Indian war, found itself targeted by Pakistan, which viewed the
situation as an opportune moment to seize Jammu and Kashmir, presuming India to be weak in
terms of defence preparation. The war initiated on 24 April 1965, when Pakistan Army, attacked
our territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This
act of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak Border Agreement

intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation Gibraltar.
The infiltration of the Gibraltar Force at various points across the 750-km long Cease-fire Line
and the international border between Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir began on 05 August 1965.
It covered areas of Jammu, Punch and Uri in the west, Tithwal in the north-west, Guraiz in the
north and Kargil in the north-east. Initially, about 1,500 infiltrators crossed over in small batches,
and concentrated at selected points inside Kashmir to organise themselves into larger groups. They
were equipped with light automatic weapons and their aim, apart from sabotage, was to
indoctrinate the Kashmiris so that they could revolt against India.3 The period of the infiltration
campaign was characterised by intense, hectic activity throughout the J&K Theatre with special
emphasis in the Valley. The raiders and own forces marched and counter-marched all over the
inhospitable terrain in a vast grim game of hide and seek. Several times during the day the
opponents met, clashed and reeled apart in a series of bloody actions, weaving a confused pattern
hard to unravel.4
The second batch of infiltrators, comprising some 6000 men, was pushed into Jammu and Kashmir
in the third week of August. Taking into account the replacements for those who ""exfiltrated"", it
is estimated that on the whole, about 8,000 infiltrators participated in these operations. By the first
week of September 1965, a third batch of infiltrators, approximately 5,500 strong, was ready in
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent across the border due to the
counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.5
The infiltrators initially worked in small groups independently. Subsequently, in the hope of better
results, they changed their tactics and started concentrating in selected areas in larger groups. Some
infiltrators exfiltrated without participating in any operation, while some others kept drifting till,
they ran into another group and merged with it. During the later phase of the operations, they were
able to establish strongholds in some areas, mostly isolated mountainous regions. Though the
Gibraltar Force succeeded in tying down a large number of the Indian security forces, it failed to
engineer an uprising in the State. They did succeed in committing some acts of sabotage and
violence, but it generally failed to achieve the objectives.

Defence, Government of IndiaOne of the major incidents related to the operations of the Gibraltar Force happened at Kralpur
Bridge on 07 August 1965. On 06 August, strong patrols were dispatched to intercept the intruders
operating in Tithwal-Kupwara area and targeting the bridges on Road Kupwara-Tithwal, as a
preliminary to infiltrating into the Valley. Meanwhile, 68 Infantry Brigade HQ with 6 DOGRA
was moved from Leh to Tangmarg, and made responsible for the operations in this sector. On 07
August, a group of 200 infiltrators was seen in area Magam, on the way to Srinagar. One Company
of 6 DOGRA and one Platoon of Punjab Armed Police intercepted the group, killing one and
arresting 5 intruders. One Indian OR was also killed in the encounter. Later at night, the raiders
attacked the bridges at Kralapur and Sonarwain, and damaged them. A Platoon of ‘A' Company of
4 KUMAON was tasked to protect the bridge at Kralpur on road Kupwara-Chokibal-Tithwal, since
it was believed that Kralpur Bridge was sure to be attacked and destroyed by the armed guerillas.
To secure the tactically important bridge, a Platoon from 'A"" Company was deployed in the bridge
area with a Section around the bridge to guard it against any threat.6
In this action, on 07 August 1965, Naik Ram Kumar was the Commander of a Section on protective
duties at Kralpur Bridge. At about 2330 hours, the enemy opened fire from the village and also
fired rockets at the bridge. The Protective Section suffered heavy casualties and its Commander
was wounded. In disregard of his personal safety Naik Ram Kumar dragged the commander away
from the bridge site. He himself was injured by grenade splinters. Despite this, when an enemy
demolition squad reached the bridge Naik Ram Kumar rushed and grappled with an enemy soldier
and managed to throw grenade, as result of which the enemy soldier carrying the demolition charge
was wounded. The others fled. Naik Ram Kumar died as a result of the bursting of his own grenade.
In the action at Kralapur Bridge, 4 KUMAON lost 10 ORs.
Throughout the action, Naik Ram Kumar displayed indomitable courage and devotion. He was
awarded Vir Chakra posthumously.

Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent across the border due to the
counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.3 The plan failed with their early detection and lack
of support from the locals, who gave away their positions.
In sheer desperation, Pakistan also employed its artillery in support of guerrilla operations in the
Chhamb area. India grasped the criticality of the ongoing plan, repulsed the attacks and cut off the
entry and exit points into the Kashmir Valley. A quick and firm response by India took Pakistan
by surprise and thwarted their well laid out plans. India reacted almost immediately by recapturing
Kargil heights which had been returned in Jul 1965, a limited offensive in the Tithwal Sector and
most importantly, the capture of Haji Pir Pass in a daring operation by 1 PARA by Major (later
Lieutenant General) Ranjit Singh Dayal under 68 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier (later
Lieutenant General) ZC Bakshi on 28 August 1965. This was one of the most notable
achievements of the riposte. The capture of Haji Pir and loss of key positions in the Kishenganga
Bulge were a severe setback for the Pakistanis which put them in a state of shock. Thus, by the
end of August 1965, Pakistan’s plans for quick annexation of the Valley had been squarely
defeated.

The failure of Operation Gibraltar saw the last phase, Operation Grand Slam put into effect by
General Ayub Khan on 01 September 1965. A massive attack was planned in the Chhamb-Jaurian
Sector aimed at capturing Akhnur, which would sever communications and cut off supply routes
to Indian troops. In desperation, Pakistan played its hand by launching Operation ‘Grand Slam’ on
01 September 1965. It was launched across the Southern most portion of the CFL and was aimed
at Akhnur; thus, Pakistan aimed at cutting of Indian positions in Naushera, Rajauri and Punch.
Thereafter, as a part of Op Grand Slam, an armoured thrust could be developed towards Jammu,
the capture of which would have severed all land communications to Jammu & Kashmir.4 This

The Pakistanis opened their offensive at 0345 hours with an intense artillery and mortar
bombardment. They shelled all our forward posts along the Cease Fire Line from Red Hill to
Burejal and engaged with heavy artillery fire the villages of MANDIALA and CHHAMB. The
gun areas came in for special attention. The staggering weight of artillery fire continued up to 0630
hours. Under cover of this massive fire-support, the enemy launched a three-pronged attack with
a force estimated to be a division of Infantry and two Regiments of Armour. At approximately
0830 hours, the Pakistanis made a thrust with a Squadron of Pattons supported by Infantry.
Simultaneously, another probing attack was made with a Squadron of Shermans from the direction
of MATTEWALA NW 5653 on to MANAWAR NW 5655. Own squadron, 20 LANCERS,
reacted sharply to these armour thrusts and managed to halt the enemy by some good shooting.
Approximately ten enemy tanks were claimed to have been knocked out.5
By last light of 01 September 1965, it became evident that 191 Infantry Brigade Group was not in
a position to withstand much longer the steam roller action of the enemy. At 2050 hours on 01
September, orders were given to the Brigade Group, less 3 MAHAR, elements 3 J and K Militia
and 6/5 GORKHA RIFLES, to withdraw to AKHNUR during that night. 3 MAHAR, 6/5
GORKHA RIFLES and remnants of 3 J&K Militia were to continue holding their defences in Area
KALIDHAR. 191 Infantry Brigade was made responsible for the defence of AKHNUR including
AKHNUR Bridge and the administrative area comprising the rear elements of the units located
there. 6 RAJPUT, already deployed for the defence of Akhnur Bridge, was placed under Command
191 Infantry Brigade.6
During the action on 01 September 1965, when Pakistani forces launched massive attack in the
Chhamb Sector, Captain Chitoor Subramanian Krishnan flew over the area in order to locate
enemy artillery guns. Disregarding heavy enemy fire, he engaged the enemy artillery guns and
ultimately silenced them. As Officer Commanding of the Air Operation Flight in Jammu and
Kashmir, Captain Chitoor Subramanian Krishnan employed his flight in directing artillery fire
against the infiltrators and inflicted heavy casualties on them. He flew nearly 60 hours, of which
45 hours were on operational sorties.

engineer an uprising in the State. The Force did succeed in committing some acts of sabotage and
violence, but it generally failed to achieve the objectives.
The first clash with the infiltrators took place on 07 August in Sunderbani Area.4 On the night of
the 09/10 August 1965, a Patrol under Major Ranbir Singh of 19 PUNJAB was sent to round up
infiltrations in the Uri Sector. The Indian Army gradually realised that the infiltrators posed a
serious threat to the security of the country and that the only way to eliminate them was to go on
the offensive, cross the Cease-fire Line, and destroy their sanctuaries inside Pakistan occupied
Kashmir (PoK). Once the decision was taken, action was swift. The first step was to recapture the
three Pakistani posts on the Kargil heights, which posed a constant danger to Srinagar-Leh Road.

into Kashmir. The link worked as the lifeline for the saboteurs operating in the Punch area. The
Pass was dominated by three adjoining hill features - Bedori in the North-East, Ledwali Gali in
the North-West and Sank in the North. The capture of these features was considered necessary for
advancing on to Haji Pir Pass. The Haji Pir Operation was planned as a major pincer movement
involving an offensive along the general axis Uri-Haji Pir Pass and a thrust along the Punch-Kahuta
axis. It was appreciated that the link-up between these forces would cut off all approach routes to
the crucial area of the bulge. 19 Infantry Division commanded by Major General SS Kalaan was
made responsible for the thrust from the North, with Haji Pir Pass as the objective. 68 Infantry
Brigade commanded by Brigadier (later Lieutenant General) ZC Bakshi was placed under
command of the Division for the task. The operation was given the code name OPERATION
BAKSHI. The link-up operation from the South code named 'OPERATION FAULAD' was to be
launched by the 93 Infantry Brigade of 25 Infantry Division, with a minimum of two Battalions.
The Pakistani strength against the 68 Infantry Brigade was estimated at three and a half battalions.5

By Second week of September many vital areas were under Indian army, but the Pakistanis were
still holding the Ring Counter and Point 8777, as well as strong positions around Gitian, from
where they could harass any movement on the Uri–Poonch road. Pt 8777 was two km south of the
Haji Pir Pass and Gitian one km. On 20 September, 6 DOGRA commanded by Lieutenant Colonel
SS Khokkar was tasked to assault and captured Pakistani positions a kilometre to the South of
Gitian (Point 7720), while 1 PARA simulated an attack on Pt 8777 and one Company of 19

4141048,Havildar,Devi Prakash Singh,15 KUMAON,"Havildar Devi Prakash Singh was born on 09 July 1936 in Badauli Village of Faizabad,
District in Uttar Pradesh. His father’s name was Rup Narain Singh. Havildar Singh was enrolled
into the KUMAON Regiment of the Indian Army on 18 August 1953 at the age of seventeen and
was posted to 15 KUMAON. During the 1965 Indo Pak War, he was deployed in the Chhamb
Sector of Jammu & Kashmir, where he managed to score a direct hit on a Pakistani tank despite
being seriously injured. He displayed exemplary courage and devotion to duty in the best traditions
of the Army.
The KUMAON Regiment traces its origins to the 18th Century and has fought in every major
campaign of the British Indian Army and the Indian Army including the two World Wars. During
World War I, a Kumaon Battalion was raised at Ranikhet on 23 October 1917 as 34/39th Kumaon
Rifles. In 1918, it was redesigned as 1st Battalion, 50th Kumaon Rifles and a second Battalion was
raised. These were merged with Hyderabad contingent into the 19th Hyderabad Regiment in 1923.
On 27 October 1945, the 19th Hyderabad was renamed as 19 Kumaon Regiment. Post
Independence, it has been known as the Kumaon Regiment. Staying true to the Regimental motto
of Parakramo Vijayate (Valour Triumphs) the Regiment has proved its mettle in Indo-Pak War of
1947-48, Sino-India War of 1962, Indo-Pak War 1971, Kargil War of 1999 and also participated
in the Indian Peace-keeping Force in Sri Lanka. During the Sino-India War of 1962, 13 KUMAON
displayed conspicuous courage and undaunted determination while fighting the enemy during the
Battle of Rezang La, where Major Shaitan Singh was awarded the Param Vir Chakra. The
KUMAON Regiment has contributed three Chiefs to the Indian Army namely General SM
Shringesh, General KS Thimayya, DSO and General TN Raina, MVC.
The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and Indian frontiers with Pakistan have remained a
sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at
several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of
Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with commendable bravery and steely
resilience, but always with great restrain to not escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak War of 1965
was the second war fought between these two bordering countries. While India was still recovering
from the damages of Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu
and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms of defence preparation. The war
initiated on 24 April 1965, when Pakistan Army, attacked our territory in the Rann of Kutch and
penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian
territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak Border Agreement 1960 and international law as per the
United Nations Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of
Operation Gibraltar.Source: http://indiastrategic.in/topstories4041_Operation_Gibraltar_was_Fundamentally_Flawed.htm
The infiltration of the Gibraltar Force at various points across the 750-km long Cease-fire Line
and the International Border between Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir began on 05 August 1965.
It covered areas of Jammu, Punch and Uri in the west, Tithwal in the North-West, Guraiz in the
North and Kargil in the North-East. Initially, about 1,500 infiltrators crossed over in small batches,
and concentrated at selected points inside Kashmir to organise themselves into larger groups. They
were equipped with light automatic weapons and their aim, apart from sabotage, was toindoctrinate the Kashmiris so that they could revolt against India.1 The period of the infiltration
campaign was characterised by intense, hectic activity throughout the J&K Theatre with special
emphasis in the Valley. The raiders and own forces marched and counter-marched all over the
inhospitable terrain in a vast grim game of hide and seek. Several times during the day the
opponents met, clashed and reeled apart in a series of bloody actions, weaving a confused pattern
hard to unravel.2
The second batch of infiltrators, comprising some 6000 men, was pushed into Jammu and Kashmir
in the third week of August. Taking into account the replacements for those who ""exfiltrated"", it
is estimated that on the whole, about 8,000 infiltrators participated in these operations. By the first
week of September 1965, a third batch of infiltrators, approximately 5,500 strong, was ready in
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent across the border due to the
counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.3 The plan failed with their early detection and lack
of support from the locals, who gave away their positions.
In sheer desperation, Pakistan also employed its artillery in support of guerrilla operations in the
Chhamb area. India grasped the criticality of the ongoing plan, repulsed the attacks and cut off the
entry and exit points into the Kashmir Valley. A quick and firm response by India took Pakistan
by surprise and thwarted their well laid out plans. India reacted almost immediately by recapturing
Kargil heights which had been returned in Jul 1965, a limited offensive in the Tithwal Sector and
most importantly, the capture of Haji Pir Pass in a daring operation by 1 PARA by Major (later
Lieutenant General) Ranjit Singh Dayal under 68 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier (later
Lieutenant General) ZC Bakshi on 28 August 1965. This was one of the most notable
achievements of the riposte. The capture of Haji Pir and loss of key positions in the Kishenganga
Bulge were a severe setback for the Pakistanis which put them in a state of shock. Thus, by the
end of August 1965, Pakistan’s plans for quick annexation of the Valley had been squarely
defeated.
The failure of Operation Gibraltar saw the last phase, Operation Grand Slam put into effect by
General Ayub Khan on 01 September 1965. A massive attack was planned in the Chhamb-Jaurian
Sector aimed at capturing Akhnur, which would sever communications and cut off supply routes
to Indian troops. In desperation, Pakistan played its hand by launching Operation ‘Grand Slam’ on
01 September 1965. It was launched across the Southern most portion of the CFL and was aimed

Thereafter, as a part of Op Grand Slam, an armoured thrust could be developed towards Jammu,
the capture of which would have severed all land communications to Jammu & Kashmir.4 This
would place Pakistan in a position to dictate terms to India.

The Pakistanis opened their offensive at 0345 hours with an intense artillery and mortar
bombardment. They shelled all our forward posts along the Cease Fire Line from Red Hill to
Burejal and engaged Mandiala and Chhamb with heavy artillery fire. The gun areas came in for
special attention. The staggering weight of artillery fire continued up to 0630 hours. Under cover
of this massive fire-support, the enemy launched a three-pronged attack with a force estimated to
be an Infantry Division and two Regiments of Armour. At approximately 0830 hours, the
Pakistanis made a thrust with a Squadron of Pattons supported by Infantry. Simultaneously,
another probing attack was made with a Squadron of Shermans from the direction of Mattewala
on to Manawar. Own Squadron, of 20 LANCERS commanded by Major Bhaskar Roy, reacted

Approximately ten enemy tanks were claimed to have been knocked out.5
By 1000 hrs, Pakistan had cut off 3 MAHAR from other Indian troops, south of Dewa. One AMX
Troop, rushed from area Chhamb, was also caught on the run and destroyed by Pakistani armour.
Indian Posts at Moel, Paur and Burejal were also overrun. Advancing further, Pakistani tanks
attacked the forward defence line of 15 KUMAON and nearly overran its two forward Companies.
This brought Pakistani tanks within 450 m of Headquarters 191 Infantry Brigade. At this juncture,
in a remarkable performance, a 15 KUMAON recoilless gun destroyed the leading Pakistani tank
and knocked out the barrel of the following tank. Apprehending more recoilless and tanks in the
Mandiala area, Pakistani tanks turned Southwards.6
By last light of 01 September 1965, 191 Infantry Brigade Group was not in a position to withstand
much longer the steam roller action of the enemy. At 2050 hours on 01 September, orders were
given to the Brigade Group, less 3 MAHAR, elements 3 J and K Militia and 6/5 GORKHA
RIFLES, to withdraw to Akhnur during that night. 3 MAHAR, 6/5 GORKHA RIFLES and
remnants of 3 J&K Militia were to continue holding their defences in Area Kalidhar. 191 Infantry
Brigade was made responsible for the defence of Akhnur including Akhnur Bridge and the
administrative area comprising the rear elements of the units located there. 6 RAJPUT, already
deployed for the defence of Akhnur Bridge, was placed under Command 191 Infantry Brigade.7
During this operation, Havildar Devi Prakash Singh of 15 KUMAON was hit in the arm by an
enemy bullet, while commanding a Platoon in its forward location. He was ordered to report to the
Regimental Aid Post by his Company Commander and to stay there. However, he went back to
fight alongside his comrades and, on reaching the Platoon area, he found four enemy tanks
approaching towards his position. Disregarding his injury, he aimed a Rocket Launcher towards
an enemy tank, but was wounded in the waist by a burst from an enemy Browning Machine Gun
before he could open fire. He again got up and managed to score a direct hit on a tank which was
later destroyed. The other enemy tanks then turned round and retreated. Later, Havildar Devi
Prakash Singh succumbed to his injuries.
Throughout the action, Havildar Devi Prakash Singh displayed exemplary courage, initiative and
devotion to duty in the best traditions of the Army. He was awarded Vir Chakra posthumously.

IC-14015,Major,Sat Parkash Varma,3/8 GORKHA RIFLES,"The first battalion of Gurkha Regiment (now Gorkha Rifles) was raised in 1815 during the
Anglo-Nepalese war. Impressed by the qualities displayed by Gurkhas during the war, the
British started active recruitment of Gurkhas into the British Indian army. After the partition,
in 1947 six Gurkha regiments viz, 1 GR, 3 GR, 4 GR, 5 GR, 8 GR and 9 GR remained with the
Indian Army, while 2 GR, 6 GR, 7 GR and 10 GR were transferred to British Army as part of
the Tripartite Agreement signed between India, Nepal and Britain. The 9 GORKHA RIFLES
was raised in 1817 at Infantry Levy at Fatehgarh as Fatehgarh Levy. In 1823, it became 63rd
Regiment a regular unit as part of the Bengal Native Infantry. Following the reorganisation
after 1857, the designation was changed to 9th Bengal Native Infantry with one of its
Companies formed by Gorkhas and other hillmen. In 1893, the regiment became a wholly
Gorkha unit before finally designated as 9th GORKHA RIFLES in 1903. The Regiment fought
in Europe during World War I and in Italy and North West Frontier during World War II. Since
independence, the Regiment has proved its mettle in Sino-India War of 1962 where it fought
under the most demanding conditions on the Namka Chu in NEFA (Now Arunachal Pradesh).
Later, the Regiment was also involved in Indo-Pak War of 1965 and 1971. 1 The Regiment’s
motto is ‘Kafar Hunu Bhanda Marnu Ramro’ (Better to die than live like a coward). In the
Sino-India war of 1962, the regiment was posted in the North-East Frontier Agency Sector
(NEFA) and fought valiantly in the crucial battles in Namka Chu Sector.
The genesis of the Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of
contention between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state
of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our
frontiers with Pakistan have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off
resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India
to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed

The objective of the limited offensive launched by the Indian security forces in the Tithwal
sector was to secure a series of tactically important features. On 24 August at 2130 hrs, 1 SIKH
less two companies, supported by 138 Mountain Battery and 17 Field Battery, attacked the
Pakistani Post on Richmar Ridge. After fierce action, by 2250 hrs, Richhmar Ridge was in the
hands of the Indian troops. 1 Sikh, with 138 Mountain Battery in support attacked Pir Sahiba
feature on the night of 25/26 August. Indian troops stealthily climbed up on the mountain and
made a bold attack for the post. The enemy fought very hard but could not defend their position.
The highest feature in Tithwal Sector, Sunjoi, which dominated the communication network
around the area, was also occupied by Pakistani infiltrators. To stop further infiltration into the
Sector, capture of this feature was of utmost significance. 3/8 GORKHA RIFLES, which had
been inducted into Tithwal sector was assigned the task to capture Sunjoi feature. The Sunjoi
feature was held by 1 Company of Azad Kashmir (POK) troops and a company plus of
Khurram Militia.
Major Varma was commanding ‘A’ Company of the 3/8 GR. On 03 September 1965, he was
tasked to lead the operation. Maj SP Varma swung into action along with his soldiers and
deployed the troops for the planned assault. However, he realized that the approach to the
enemy post was barred by a high stone wall. The stone wall acted like a big barrier, which
temporarily halted his assault. Rising to the demand of the situation, Maj SP Varma directed
rocket launchers at the barrier, creating a breach that allowed his forces to advance.
This forceful attack enabled Maj SP Varma and his comrades to advance further and soon they
over-ran the enemy forward positions. Despite encountering heavy enemy fire, Major Varma
and his men silenced the enemy bunkers one by one. In a close encounter, he used his Khukri
to eliminate two Pakistani soldiers. In the process, he was however hit in the stomach by two
bursts of enemy MMG. Even then he continued to encourage his men and ultimately succeeded
in capturing the objective. With the capture of Sunjoi, the Indian troops reached the outskirts
of Mirpur, a few km north-east of Muzaffarabad, establishing dominance over the area east of
the Kishanganga river.3/8 Gorkha Rifles captured Sunjoi feature on night 3/4 Sep '65.

seriously wounded, he continued providing effective artillery support and destroyed many enemy
bunkers with precision shoots. Later in his meritorious career, he served as the Director General
of the Artillery and retired from the Army in the year 1990.1
The Regiment of Artillery was raised on 28 September 1827. It was initially raised as Bombay
Artillery and was later renamed 5 Bombay Mountain Battery. In May 1857, the mutiny by Indian
soldiers started in the artillery of the Army of the Bengal Presidency. The incident prompted a
complete ban on Indian artillery units, except the mountain artillery batteries in select provinces.
The decision was reversed in the mid-1930s when the first of the Field Regiments of the Indian

entry and exit points into the Kashmir Valley. A quick and firm response by India took Pakistan
by surprise and thwarted their well laid out plans. India reacted almost immediately by recapturing
Kargil heights which had been returned in Jul 1965, a limited offensive in the Tithwal Sector and
most importantly, the capture of Haji Pir Pass in a daring operation by 1 PARA by Major (later
Lieutenant General) Ranjit Singh Dayal under 68 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier (later
Lieutenant General) ZC Bakshi on 28 August 1965. This was one of the most notable
achievements of the riposte. The capture of Haji Pir and loss of key positions in the Kishenganga
Bulge were a severe setback for the Pakistanis which put them in a state of shock. Thus, by the
end of August 1965, Pakistan’s plans for quick annexation of the Valley had been squarely
defeated.

The failure of Operation Gibraltar saw the last Phase, Operation Grand Slam put into effect by
General Ayub Khan on 01 September 1965. A massive attack was planned in the Chhamb-Jaurian
Sector aimed at capturing Akhnur, which would sever communications and cut off supply routes
to Indian troops. In desperation, Pakistan played its hand by launching Operation ‘Grand Slam’ on
01 September 1965. It was launched across the Southern most portion of the CFL and was aimed
at Akhnur; thus, Pakistan aimed at cutting of Indian positions in Naushera, Rajauri and Punch.
Thereafter, as a part of Operation Grand Slam, an armoured thrust could be developed towards
Jammu, the capture of which would have severed all land communications to Jammu & Kashmir.5
This would place Pakistan in a position to dictate terms to India.
While 68 Infantry Brigade was carrying out its grim battle for the capture of the Hajipir Pass, 93
Infantry Brigade had, after an initial setback, been pushing Northwards to establish a link up for
lopping off the Bulge. Between Punch and Kahuta, there were many hill features which dominated
the Punch-Haji Pir track. The enemy picquets located on these features had cement emplacements

and mortars. 93 Infantry Brigade launched OPERATION FAULAD to achieve the Punch-Haji Pir
link-up by capturing these picquets. The main features of ‘OPERATION FAULAD', where the
gallant actions were fought are the capture of the Raja and Chand Tekri picquets, both of which
were considered to be virtually impregnable. These picquets were defended by a Battalion (less
Company), with 2x3.7-inch Howitzers and 2x81 mm Mortars in support. The men, equipped with
automatic weapons were entrenched in shell-proof shelters and the picquets were protected with
barbed wires and mines. In short, both picquets were turned into miniature fortresses.

On the night of 05/06 September 1965, a simultaneous attack was launched on Raja and Chand
Tekri picquets by 2 SIKH and 3 DOGRA respectively. The attack was preceded by intense artillery
shelling, but it had little impact on the built-up positions. As the approach to the objectives lay
along steep and slippery slopes, the assaulting troops had to crawl on all fours rather than walk.
When they neared the picquets, heavy automatic fire greeted them. The Indian wavered
momentarily, but inspired by bold leadership, they recovered quickly and dashed through themines and wires. A grim hand-to-hand battle raged for over two hours before the picquets fell.6
The garrison at Raja picquet fought to the last man. The Indian side also suffered heavy casualties.
During the assault on Raja Picquet on 06 September, Lieutenant Colonel NN Khanna,
Commanding Officer 2 SIKH, led his men braving the devastating fire of the enemy. Lieutenant
Colonel Khanna was decorated with the Mahavir Chakra for his exceptional courage and
leadership, posthumously.
With the fall of Raja and Chand Tekri, the back of Gibraltar Force was broken in this Sector.
Thereafter, Indian troops faced little difficulty in mopping up and liquidating the remaining
pockets of resistance in the area. The link-up was completed with the capture of Kahuta on 10
September 1965 and with that the Indian security forces closed the mouth of the bulge and sealed
the Haji Pir sector. Consequently, the enemy resistance east of the Betar Nallah also ceased.

attack on Raja Picquet. Although Major Jagdish Singh was the Battery Commander but realizing
the importance of the operation, he opted to act as Forward Observation Officer (FOO), an act
normally performed by a Captain or a Subaltern. As FOO, Major Jagdish Singh remained with the
leading Platoon during the attack and brought down accurate artillery fire on the enemy. While
attempting to direct the fire on the upper defences of the two heights, Major Jagdish Singh was
seriously wounded in the shoulder. Nevertheless, he continued to provide fire support to the
attacking troops and also destroyed many enemy machine-gun bunkers with precision shoots. The
effective artillery fire support provided by Major Jagdish Singh further raised the morale of the
attacking troops resulting in early capture of Raja Picquet.7
Throughout this action, Major Jagdish Singh displayed exemplary courage and determination in
the best traditions of the Army. He was awarded Vir Chakra.

IC-12453,Major,Greesh Chandra Verma,3 DOGRA,"Major Greesh Chandra Verma was born on 19 August 1939 in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.
His father’s name was S P Verma. Major Verma was commissioned into 3 DOGRA on 18
December 1960 at the age of twenty-one. During the 1965 Indo Pak war, he was deployed in
Poonch Sector of Jammu & Kashmir, where he fought gallantly at Raja Post and Chand Tekri
piquet’s against the Pakistani intruders and made the was supreme sacrifice for the nation.
The DOGRA Regiment, raised in 1877 is one of the older infantry regiments of the Indian Army.
The Regiment traces its roots directly from the 17th Dogra Regiment of the British Indian Army.
After World War I, the British Indian government restructured the army, moving from Regiments
with a single Battalion to multi–Battalion Regiments. In 1945, it shed the numeral ‘17’ and became
Dogra Regiment. The DOGRA Regiment has troops from Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir,
and the Northern districts of Punjab. Their Regimental war cry is “Jwala Mata Ki Jai” (Victory to
Goddess Jwala). The Dogras have participated in all the wars and conflicts fought by the Indian
Army since independence and winning laurels. General N C Vij, PVSM, UYSM, AVSM who was
the 21st Chief of the Army also belonged to the DOGRA Regiment.
The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and Indian frontiers with Pakistan have remained a
sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at
several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of
Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with commendable bravery and steely
resilience, but always with great restrain to not escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak War of 1965
was the second war fought between these two bordering countries. While India was still recovering
from the damages of Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu
and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms of defence preparation. The war
initiated on 24 April 1965, when Pakistan Army, attacked our territory in the Rann of Kutch and
penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian
territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak Border Agreement 1960 and international law as per the
United Nations Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of
Operation Gibraltar.Source: http://indiastrategic.in/topstories4041_Operation_Gibraltar_was_Fundamentally_Flawed.htm
The infiltration of the Gibraltar Force at various points across the 750-km long Cease-fire Line
and the International Border between Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir began on 05 August 1965.
It covered areas of Jammu, Punch and Uri in the west, Tithwal in the North-West, Guraiz in the
North and Kargil in the North-East. Initially, about 1,500 infiltrators crossed over in small batches,
and concentrated at selected points inside Kashmir to organise themselves into larger groups. They
were equipped with light automatic weapons and their aim, apart from sabotage, was to
indoctrinate the Kashmiris so that they could revolt against India.1 The period of the infiltration
campaign was characterised by intense, hectic activity throughout the J&K Theatre with special
emphasis in the Valley. The raiders and own forces marched and counter-marched all over the

opponents met, clashed and reeled apart in a series of bloody actions, weaving a confused pattern
hard to unravel.2
The second batch of infiltrators, comprising some 6000 men, was pushed into Jammu and Kashmir
in the third week of August. Taking into account the replacements for those who ""exfiltrated"", it
is estimated that on the whole, about 8,000 infiltrators participated in these operations. By the first
week of September 1965, a third batch of infiltrators, approximately 5,500 strong, was ready in
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent across the border due to the
counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.3 The plan failed with their early detection and lack
of support from the locals, who gave away their positions.
In sheer desperation, Pakistan also employed its artillery in support of guerrilla operations in the
Chhamb area. India grasped the criticality of the ongoing plan, repulsed the attacks and cut off the
entry and exit points into the Kashmir Valley. A quick and firm response by India took Pakistan
by surprise and thwarted their well laid out plans. India reacted almost immediately by recapturing

fired around 6,000 rounds in support of the move and to soften the target prior to the attack. The

Singh, in Jammu, Jammu & Kashmir. He was commissioned into the 18 RAJPUTANA
RIFLES on 10 June 1962. Colonel Prabhu Singh was raised in a military environment, with a
clear path set for him to join the Army. This choice was influenced by the fact that his cousins
and brothers had also pursued careers in the military. Among his siblings, Colonel Prabhu
Singh is the second, with the eldest being Major Dr. K Brahma Singh, a renowned writer and
military historian. Major Dr. K Brahma Singh has authored the Regimental history of the
former Jammu & Kashmir State Forces, now known as Jammu & Kashmir Rifles (JAK RIF),
along with other books and numerous articles. Colonel Prabhu Singh's younger brother, the late
Major General Keshav Singh, held the position of Chief of Staff of 3 Corps until his unfortunate
demise in a helicopter crash in 1997. During the 1965 Indo-Pak War, Captain Prabhu Singh
was awarded the Vir Chakra for conspicuous bravery and courage.
The Rajputana Rifles is the senior most Rifle Regiment of the Indian Army. Its first Battalion
was raised in January 1775. The Rajputana Rifles has a long and glorious history. The
Regiment took part in some of the bloodiest battles in many theatres of the world. During World
War II, the Battalions of this Regiment fought in every theatre in which the Indian Army was
involved. Three of them, the 1st, 4th and Medium Machine Gun Battalions fought in Eritrea in
North Africa and Italy as part of the famous 4th Indian Division, who's fighting record was one
of the finest in World War II. Post-independence the regiment took part in many battles and
operations including the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Congo. The Rajputana Rifles fought
gallantly in the 1965 and 1971 India Pakistan wars. During the 1965 Indo-Pak war, the
Rajputana Rifles displayed exemplary valour and determination especially in the Khem Karan
Sector. During Operation Vijay, the 1999 Kargil Conflict, 2 RAJPUTANA RIFLES served
with distinction in the Kargil Sector.
The genesis of the Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of
contention between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state
of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our
frontiers with Pakistan have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off
resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India
to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed
Forces with commendable bravery and steely resilience, but always with great restraint to not
escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak War of 1965 was the second war fought between these two
bordering countries. While India was still recovering from the Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan
saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be
weak in terms of defence preparation. The war began on 24 April 1965, when the Pakistan
Army attacked Indian territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside
the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of
the Indo-Pak Border Agreement,1960 and the international law as per the United Nations
Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation
Gibraltar. The 1965 war was fought in various Sectors including in Khem Karan under 4
Mountain Division and 2(Independent) Armoured Brigade.18 RAJ RIF then was part of 4 Mountain Division, which along with 7 and 15 Infantry
Divisions was given the task of attacking Lahore.
In the dense jungles of Kasur, Pakistan's 1 Armoured Division, armed with American M46
Patton tanks, remained hidden. The 4 Mountain Division, lacking adequate time for
reconnaissance, launched an attack on Kasur on 06 September after arriving in the area on 04
and 05 September. Despite expecting minimal resistance from a single Infantry Battalion, the
assaulting force, comprising two Brigades and a Regiment of World War II-era Sherman tanks,
encountered a reinforced Pakistani Brigade with armour and the entire 1st Armoured Division.
The Indian offensive proved unsuccessful. On the Southern flank, in the 18 RAJ RIF area,
Captain Prabhu Singh demonstrated remarkable courage by capturing three Pakistani Posts
despite strong opposition. However, isolated and facing the imminent threat of a superior
Pakistani counterattack, he received orders to retreat and relocate to his unit with his company.
Facing the imminent threat of an attack from the Pakistani Armoured Division, the entire 4
Mountain Division received orders to fall back and establish a defensive position in the shape
of a horseshoe around the village of Assal Uttar. Captain Prabhu Singh, serving with 18 RAJ
RIF, was tasked with situating his Company's defences in this critical location. Despite the
challenging soft terrain, making digging trenches an uphill struggle with mud constantly
slipping, Captain Prabhu Singh and other units worked diligently. In a somewhat mysterious
turn of events, there was an unexplained one-day delay on the part of the Pakistani Armoured
Division in launching their attack. This delay afforded the Indian forces valuable time to fortify
their defences and flood the nearby sugar cane fields. The full-force attack finally ensued on
09 September. On the front held by 18 RAJ RIF, Captain Prabhu Singh's position faced a
relentless and furious assault. In response, his forces unleashed a formidable defence, with 106
mm RCL guns, mortars, and other weapons engaging and destroying Pakistani tanks. Despite
the relentless onslaught of Pakistani tanks manoeuvring over trenches, attempting to crush
those within, Captain Prabhu Singh and his men displayed unwavering courage. The battlefield
resounded with the deafening noise of artillery, tanks, RCL guns, and infantry weapons all
firing simultaneously.
As the battle wore on, the ammunition supply dwindled, and at one point, a rumour circulated
that the entire Battalion had withdrawn. However, this had no impact on Captain Prabhu Singh
and his men, as withdrawal was never in their thoughts. Captain Prabhu Singh communicated
the ammunition shortage to his Commanding Officer, who, though unable to offer substantial
help, proposed artillery support. Despite the risky nature of such support in the midst of the
battle's chaos and the close proximity of Indian and Pakistani troops, Captain Prabhu Singh,
facing a desperate situation, accepted the offer without yielding an inch from his defensive
position.
The resolute stance of Captain Prabhu Singh and his men so disconcerted the Pakistanis that
they began abandoning their tanks and fleeing, leaving their engines running. The Pakistani
attack on the 18 RAJ RIF front lost momentum due to the determined and heroic resistance
displayed by Captain Prabhu Singh and his men, as well as the significant tank losses inflicted
by this courageous group. Consequently, the Pakistani Armoured Division withdrew from thissector. The following day, on 10 September, they launched an attack on another Brigade
position where they faced further defeat at the hands of 4 GRENADIERS, with Company
Quarter Master Havildar (CQMH) Abdul Hamid single-handedly knocking out four Patton
tanks with his 106 mm RCL gun before being killed in action. In recognition of his gallantry,
he was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra.

On the 9th September, 1965, the enemy having failed in his attacks on other companies,

The Corps of Engineers is one of the oldest arms of the Indian Army. The origin of the Corps dates
back to 1780 when the two regular pioneer companies were raised in the Madras Presidency Army.
Subsequently, the Group of Madras, Bengal and Bombay Sappers were formed in their respective
presidencies. These Groups came together when the British Indian Army was formed after 1857
and were later merged on 18 November 1932 to form the Corps of Indian Engineers. Engineer
Groups initially consisted of field companies (a sub-unit organization that exists to this day). Till
1911, the Sappers also had the duty of passing battlefield messages. Between 1911 and 1920, they
handed this task to a batch of their own kinsmen who then formed the Corps of Signals. The
Sappers also contributed the first batch of airmen when the Indian Air Force was raised in 1932.
From 1942-1945 officers of the Indian Railways were recruited into this Corps to participate in
Britain’s Burma Campaign. The former Chief of the Army Staff General Manoj Pande, PVSM

United Nations Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of
Operation Gibraltar.

The infiltration of the Gibraltar Force at various points across the 750-km long Cease-fire Line
and the International Border between Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir began on 05 August 1965.It covered areas of Jammu, Punch and Uri in the West, Tithwal in the North-West, Guraiz in the
North and Kargil in the North-East. Initially, about 1,500 infiltrators crossed over in small batches,
and concentrated at selected points inside Kashmir to organise themselves into larger groups. They
were equipped with light automatic weapons and their aim, apart from sabotage, was to
indoctrinate the Kashmiris so that they could revolt against India.2 The period of the infiltration
campaign was characterised by intense, hectic activity throughout the J&K Theatre with special
emphasis in the Valley. The raiders and own forces marched and counter-marched all over the
inhospitable terrain in a vast grim game of hide and seek. Several times during the day the
opponents met, clashed and reeled apart in a series of bloody actions, weaving a confused pattern
hard to unravel.3
The second batch of infiltrators, comprising some 6000 men, was pushed into Jammu and Kashmir
in the third week of August. Taking into account the replacements for those who ""exfiltrated"", it
is estimated that on the whole, about 8,000 infiltrators participated in these operations. By the first
week of September 1965, a third batch of infiltrators, approximately 5,500 strong, was ready in
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent across the border due to the
counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.4 The plan failed with their early detection and lack
of support from the locals, who gave away their positions.

In sheer desperation, Pakistan also employed its artillery in support of guerrilla operations in the
Chhamb area. India grasped the criticality of the ongoing plan, repulsed the attacks and cut off the
entry and exit points into the Kashmir Valley. A quick and firm response by India took Pakistan
by surprise and thwarted their well laid out plans. India reacted almost immediately by recapturing
Kargil heights which had been returned in Jul 1965, a limited offensive in the Tithwal Sector and
most importantly, the capture of Haji Pir Pass in a daring operation by 1 PARA by Major (later
Lieutenant General) Ranjit Singh Dayal under 68 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier (later
Lieutenant General) ZC Bakshi on 28 August 1965. This was one of the most notable
achievements of the riposte. The capture of Haji Pir and loss of key positions in the Kishenganga
Bulge were a severe setback for the Pakistanis which put them in a state of shock. Thus, by theend of August 1965, Pakistan’s plans for quick annexation of the Valley had been squarely
defeated.
The failure of Operation Gibraltar saw the last phase, Operation Grand Slam put into effect by
General Ayub Khan on 01 September 1965. A massive attack was planned in the Chhamb-Jaurian
Sector aimed at capturing Akhnur, which would sever communications and cut off supply routes
to Indian troops. In desperation, Pakistan played its hand by launching Operation ‘Grand Slam’ on
01 September 1965. It was launched across the Southern most portion of the CFL and was aimed
at Akhnur; thus, Pakistan aimed at cutting of Indian positions in Naushera, Rajauri and Punch.
Thereafter, as a part of Op Grand Slam, an armoured thrust could be developed towards Jammu,
the capture of which would have severed all land communications to Jammu & Kashmir.5 This
would place Pakistan in a position to dictate terms to India.

https://usiofindia.org/publication/usi-journal/1965-indo-pak-war-a-critical-appraisal/Dera Baba Nanak (DBN) was of strategic importance mainly because of the rail-cum-road bridge
over the Ravi River. In January 1960, as per the Indo-Pak Agreement, the 1.5-km long bridge had
been given to Pakistan while the Hussainiwala Bridge over the Sutlej River went to India. A narrow
Pakistani Enclave existed on the Indian side of the Ravi while a larger Indian enclave existed on
the Western side opposite the Jassar township. Jassar’s strategic importance is evident—it was
connected to Sialkot via Narowal and Pasrur by both rail and road. It was also linked to DBN on
the Indian side by the 1,500-metre rail-cum-road bridge. Any Pakistani ingress in the area would
then take them from DBN to Batala and Ajnala which would then make the Amritsar–Pathankot
Road vulnerable. From the Pakistani point of view, the reverse was equally relevant; an Indian
offensive from DBN to Jassar could then seriously threaten the flanking and rear defences of
Sialkot.6 29 Infantry Brigade under Brigadier Pritam Singh had earlier been a part of 7 Infantry
Division, but with its three Battalions—2 MADRAS, 2 RAJPUTANA RIFLES, and 1/5 GORKHA
RIFLES—had been delinked and given the task of capturing the Jassar Bridge to the Northwest of
Amritsar in the Dera Baba Nanak (DBN) Sector.
Brigadier Pritam Singh’s 29 Infantry Brigade had three Infantry Battalions at DBN—2 MADRAS
with Lieutenant Colonel CV Donoghue at the helm, 2 RAJ RIF being commanded by Lieutenant
Colonel Vohra, and 1/5 GORKHA RIFLES under Lieutenant Colonel SNS Gurung. At the
designated 11 Corps H-hour, 2 MADRAS and elements of 2 RAJ RIF started to clear the Pakistani
Enclave which was heavily defended by Pakistan’s 3 PUNJAB and a Company of Sutlej Rangers,
a few artillery guns, and some tanks. The fighting was fierce and by first light 2 MADRAS had
recovered thirty-two bodies and taken ten POWs. However, a part of the Enclave held out and,
despite engaging the concrete observation tower with 106 mm RCL guns and even tanks, the
Observation Post could not be destroyed.
While 2 MADRAS and 2 RAJ RIF had engaged the Enclave, 1/5 GORKHA RIFLES had occupied
the Dhusi Bund that overlooked the Bridge’s exit from the Indian side. At 1400 hours, Pakistan’s
115 Infantry Brigade counter-attacked across the Bridge with its 25-pounder guns providing
accurate covering fire from across the river under the guidance of its observers on the tower. A
Troop of Pakistani tanks supported by infantry came across the bridge while the tanks in the
Pakistani Enclave around the observation tower also gave covering fire. Having established a
bridgehead across the DBN Bridge, the Pakistanis launched a second attack on the 2 MADRAS
and 1/5 GORKHA RIFLES positions with the intention of enlarging their hold. This attack failed
as the Indians resolutely fought back. At 0245 hours, 2 RAJ RIF counter-attacked. The Pakistanis,
thinking a major attack was developing, fell back, leaving two of their serviceable tanks behind.

tanks could approach the Indian positions over the bridge again.7
During these attacks, the ENGINEER REGIMENT was tasked to provide logistic and technical
support to those on the frontline. They were given charge of the area that was less than a couple
of kilometres from the enemy watchtowers and bunkers. Removing obstacles like mines and
explosives, constructing instant bridges and roads and destroying enemy installations were the
responsibilities of the Madras Engineers Group.8 From 06 to 22 September, 1965, Second
Lieutenant N Chandra Sekharan Nair of Corps of Engineers was commanding an Engineer
Platoon. He laid anti-tank mines on the near side of Dara Baba Nanak bridge, in the face of heavy
artillery and small Arms fire of the enemy. He also carried out a number of reconnaissances to
assess the damage caused by enemy action to the bridge and provided valuable information for
future planning.
Throughout the action Second Lieutenant Second Lieutenant N. Chandra Sekharan Nair showed
exemplary devotion to duty and commendable courage in the highest traditions of the Indian Army.
He was awarded Vir chakra for his gallantry.

JC-8199,Subedar Major & Hony Captain (Then Subedar),Khazan Singh,3 JAT,"Subedar Khazan Singh was born on 15 December 1926, to Subedar Tulsi Ram, in Jhajjar,
Haryana. He was enrolled into the 3 JAT on 15 May 1944, the same Battalion his father and
grandfather had served in. During the 1965 Indo-Pak war, Subedar Khazan Singh was awarded
the Vir Chakra for conspicuous bravery and courage.
The JAT Regiment is one of the oldest Regiments of the Indian Army. It is an Infantry
Regiment that claims its origins to the Calcutta Native Militia raised in 1795, which later
became an Infantry Battalion of the Bengal Army. Jat people were historically considered to
be martial class and were enlisted in the British Army when the policy on class regiments came.
In 1922, during the grouping of the class Regiment the 9 Jat Regiment was formed by bringing
under a single Regiment, four active Battalions and one Training Battalion. In the post-
independent era, the JAT Regiment has lived up to their reputation and holds the distinction of
fighting in all the wars that India fought since its independence including the IPKF to Sri Lanka.
Their battle cry: Jat Balwan, Jai Bhagwan was adopted in 1955. 17 JAT received “Unit","” from the Chief of the Army Staff, General VP Malik for their conspicuous courage
in the Kargil War.
The genesis of the Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of
contention between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state
of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our
frontiers with Pakistan have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off
resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India
to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed
Forces with commendable bravery and steely resilience, but always with great restraint to not
escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak War of 1965 was the second war fought between these two
bordering countries. While India was still recovering from the Sino-India War of 1962,
Pakistan saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might, presuming India
to be weak in terms of defence preparation. The war began on 24 April 1965, when the Pakistan
Army attacked Indian territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside
the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of
the Indo-Pak Border Agreement ,1960 and the international law as per the United Nations
Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation
Gibraltar.
Dograi is a small town in Pakistan along the Amritsar-Lahore Road, and serves as the gateway
to Lahore, located just 13 km North East. Due to its strategic position, it was fiercely defended.
The 54 Infantry Brigade of the Indian Army was assigned to capture Dograi. Despite earlier
attempts by two Indian Army Battalions, success was elusive. Ultimately, the 3 JAT
commanded by Lieutenant Colonel (later Brigadier) Desmond Hayde, part of the same Brigade,
was entrusted with capturing this crucial town, positioned on both sides of the Ichhogil canal,
a significant water barrier.
3 JAT, backed by Divisional Artillery, planned a significant flanking manoeuvre covering 6000
yards to seize Dograi from the North. On 21 September, 3 JAT carried out extensive patrolling
to gather intelligence on Dograi, which was to be attacked in the night. It was discovered thatthe Pakistanis were well entrenched. There were minefield and wire entanglements. The town
itself was guarded by reinforced concrete pill-boxes around its three approaches.
Subedar Khazan Singh was commanding B Company during the first assault on Dograi during
the intervening night of 05/06 September, 1965. When the Company was approaching the
enemy, it came under heavy Machine Gun fire from a grove. During intense exchange of fire,
Subedar Khazan Singh’s helmet was hit by a bullet, although he fell unconscious, he was saved
by his helmet. On gaining consciousness, Subedar Khazan Singh saw an enemy Machine Gun
still engaging his Company. With total disregard to his personal safety, he rushed forward with
his gun and silenced it. In the encounter, he came face to face with the enemy Company
Commander and shot him dead. In the midst of intense combat near Canal Bridge, his Company
faced heavy enemy fire from the Southern direction. Undaunted, Subedar Khazan Singh
personally led a second assault. Engaging in hand-to-hand combat, he was seriously injured
but swiftly rose to rejoin the attack. After nearly thirty minutes of close quarters fighting, B
Company triumphantly seized the objective with minimal casualties.

The Rajput Regiment is one of the oldest Infantry Regiments of the Indian Army, tracing its origins
to 1778 with the raising of the 24th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry. The 1st Battalion of the
Regiment was formed in 1798. After World War I, the Indian Army was restructured, and most
Rajput Regiments became Battalions of the 7th Rajput Regiment. These included the 2nd Queen
Victoria’s Own, 4th Prince Albert Victor’s, 7th (Duke of Connaught’s Own), and 11 Rajput.
Before India gained independence from the British Empire, the Regiment consisted of Rajputs and
Punjabi Muslims. The Regimental insignia is a pair of crossed Rajputi Katars flanked by three
Ashoka leaves on either side. This is mounted by the Lion Capital of Ashoka and a scroll below
with the words “The Rajput Regiment” The Regimental motto of Rajput Regiment is ‘Sarvatra
Vijaya’ meaning ‘Victory everywhere’. In Operation VIJAY 1999, 27 RAJUPT displayed

Pakistan did not call off Operation ‘Grand Slam' despite the security council's call for an immediate
cease-fire on 4 September 1965. It even carried out an air raid on Amritsar the next day. The Indian
warning that an attack against Jammu and Kashmir would be treated as an attack against India was
also ignored by Pakistan. Meanwhile, apprehending a Pakistani attack, India had also formulated
a contingency plan to meet the situation militarily. The Indian plan visualised a limited offensive
intended to cover the area from Dera Baba Nanak in the North to the Sutlej in the South.

The objective of the retaliatory Indian plan was to threaten Lahore, drive a wedge between the
Pakistani forces deployed in the Lahore and Sialkot sectors and destroy their war potential. The
offensive was to serve the dual purpose of ensuring the security of Punjab by advancing the Indiandefence line to the Ichhogil Canal and to capture some Pakistani territory to serve as a bargaining
lever in the political parleys, on the conclusion of hostilities.
In view of the above plan, XI Corps under Lieutenant General JS Dhillon was assigned the tasks
on August 1965 to destroy the enemy forces which might enter Punjab and Ganganagar Sector in
Rajasthan. Also, on orders from Lieutenant General Harbaksh Singh, GOC-in-C Western
Command, the Corps was to undertake the following measures simultaneously:
a. To advance to the Ichhogil Canal along the axes GT road, Bhikkiwind-Khalra and
Bhikkiwind-Khem Karan, to secure Pakistani territory from opposite Ranian inclusive to
its junction with Dipalpur Canal opposite Hussainiwala. Also to capture intact Ichhogil
Uttar road bridge, GT road bridge, Jallo road bridge and Barki bridge on Ichhogil Canal
b. To eliminate the Pakistani bridge-head at the Dera Baba Nanak and if possible, capture the
bridge on the Ravi River, intact.
The initial task of XI Corps was to secure the East bank of the Ichhogil Canal and establish
bridgeheads across the Canal at some points. Surprise was achieved and the three Indian Divisions
gained notable success. In the south, 4 Mountain Division, under Maj Gen Gurbakhsh Singh,
launched an attack on the Khem Karan-Kasur axis and succeeded in capturing all its objectives,
either wholly or partially, by 1230 hrs on 06 September. Further North, 7 Infantry Division, under
Maj Gen H K Sibal, captured Hudiara by 1030 hrs. 15 Infantry Division under Maj Gen Niranjan
Prasad achieved some early success. One of its Battalions, 3 JAT crossed the Ichhogil Canal at
Dograi and reached Batapore on the outskirts of Lahore. Another battalion of the Division
advanced upto the road bridge over this Canal near Bhaini Dhilwal, 9 km north of Dograi. The
bridge over the Ravi River at Dera Baba Nanak was captured by 29 Infantry Brigade. These
attacks, launched with speed and vigour, jolted Pakistan.
7 Infantry Division was to secure Pakistani territory up to the East bank of the Ichhogil Canal from
the Canal Track Junction (exclusive) to the Canal junction near Bedian (inclusive). In carrying out
the task, priority was to be given to the capture and holding of the bridge over the Ichhogil Canal
at Barki, and to deny any ingress through Bedian. One battalion was to be left for the defence of
the Hussainiwala bridge, and it was to come under the command of 7 Infantry Division on arrival.
The boundary between 7 Infantry Division and 4 Mountain Division was to be the Canal Junction-

7 Infantry Division was tasked to advance along the Khalra-Barki axis. The International Border
between India and Pakistan cut this axis just 1.6 km North West of Khalra, which was inside India.
On the way to Lahore, the Upper Bhuchar Distributary and the Hudiara Drain both running at the
right angle to the road, were the two major obstacles. The Ichhogil was the third and most
formidable obstacle, and Barki was located about 500 m to the east of it. The Operation Plan of 7
Infantry Division was to be carried out in two phases;Phase I
(a) Capture of the bridge at Barki by 48 Infantry Brigade Group by last light on 06 September.
(b) Blocking the Pakistani ingress through Bedian by 17 RAJPUT by last light on 06 September.
(c) After the capture of the Hudiara Drain, 65 Infantry Brigade to send one Infantry Battalion to
destroy the bridge over the Ichhogil near the Hir village.
Phase II

Brigadier K J S Shahaney, contacted Pakistani defences at Hudiara at about 0700 Hours on 06
September. They came under heavy, long-range automatic fire from Pakistani positions at Hudiara,
Nurpur and Hudiara Drain. By this time, 17 RAJPUT under the command of Lieutenant Colonel
AS Gill, had captured the Pakistani Border Post East of Bedian, achieving complete surprise. It
was, however, halted about 550 m to the East of the Bedian bridge, when the defenders opened up
with artillery, tanks and MMGs. The Corps Commander then ordered GOC 7 Infantry Division to
mine the 17 RAJPUT area and prevent Pakistani ingress from Bedian at any cost. The preparations
for the attack on Hudiara continued despite heavy artillery and automatic fire. By 1030 hrs, 6/8
GORKHA RIFLES, under the command of Lt Col G A Nagle, secured the Hudiara village, but
could not attack the Hudiara Drain, in the face of accurate artillery and small arms automatic fire.

13657947,Guardsman,Dambar Bahadur Chhetri,5 GUARDS,"Guardsman Dambar Bahadur Chettri was born on 04 April 1945 at Lapsibot village of
Pallo Nawakot District in Nepal. His father’s name was Shri Dina Nath Chhetri. Guardsman
Dambar Bahadur Chettri was enrolled into 5 GUARDS of the Indian Army on 04 April 1963 at
the age of eighteen. During the 1965 Indo Pak War, he was part of Company attacking a strongly
held enemy position in the Lahore Secor, where despite being injured, he fought gallantly, and
inflicted heavy causalities on the enemy.
The Brigade of The Guards is a Regiment of the Indian Army. The troops from all parts of the
country serve in various battalions of this regiment. The regiment was formed in 1949 as the first
mixed class Indian regiment by Field Marshal KM Cariappa OBE. The GUARDS Brigade was
raised to implement the government’s policy of encouraging army recruitment from regions under-
represented in the forces. Four of the Army’s oldest battalions - 2 PUNJAB, 1
GRENADIERS, 1 RAJ RIF and 1 RAJPUT were converted as the GUARDS Battalions in 1949.
Though the Brigade of Guards is only 50 years old, its constituent Battalions go back as far as 225
years. They also share 93 Battle Honours earned around the world. At the moment, the Regiment
consists of 19 battalions. The majority of these operate as Mechanised Infantry. During the first
war of Kashmir 1 RAJPUT (4 GUARDS) showed their mettle in the battle of Taindhar, where
Naik Jadunath Singh fought valiantly and won the first Param Vir Chakra for his Regiment. During
the 1971 Indo-Pak War, the regiment earned its second Param Vir Chakra through Lance Naik
Albert Ekka of 14 GUARDS for heroism in Gangasagar in the Eastern Theatre.
The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and Indian frontiers with Pakistan have remained a
sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at
several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of
Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with commendable bravery and steely
resilience, but always with great restrain to not escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak War of 1965
was the second war fought between these two bordering countries. While India was still recovering
from the damages of Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu
and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms of defence preparation. The war
initiated on 24 April 1965, when Pakistan Army, attacked our territory in the Rann of Kutch and
penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian
territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak Border Agreement 1960 and international law as per the
United Nations Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of
Operation Gibraltar.
The infiltration of the Gibraltar Force at various points across the 750-km long Cease-fire Line
and the International Border between Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir began on 05 August 1965.
It covered areas of Jammu, Punch and Uri in the west, Tithwal in the North-West, Guraiz in theNorth and Kargil in the North-East. Initially, about 1,500 infiltrators crossed over in small batches,
and concentrated at selected points inside Kashmir to organise themselves into larger groups. They
were equipped with light automatic weapons and their aim, apart from sabotage, was to
indoctrinate the Kashmiris so that they could revolt against India.1 The period of the infiltration
campaign was characterised by intense, hectic activity throughout the J&K Theatre with special
emphasis in the Valley. The raiders and own forces marched and counter-marched all over the
inhospitable terrain in a vast grim game of hide and seek. Several times during the day the
opponents met, clashed and reeled apart in a series of bloody actions, weaving a confused pattern
hard to unravel.2
The second batch of infiltrators, comprising some 6000 men, was pushed into Jammu and Kashmir
in the third week of August. Taking into account the replacements for those who ""exfiltrated"", it
is estimated that on the whole, about 8,000 infiltrators participated in these operations. By the first
week of September 1965, a third batch of infiltrators, approximately 5,500 strong, was ready in
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent across the border due to the
counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.3 The plan failed with their early detection and lack
of support from the locals, who gave away their positions.
In sheer desperation, Pakistan also employed its artillery in support of guerrilla operations in the
Chhamb area. India grasped the criticality of the ongoing plan, repulsed the attacks and cut off the
entry and exit points into the Kashmir Valley. A quick and firm response by India took Pakistan
by surprise and thwarted their well laid out plans. India reacted almost immediately by recapturing
Kargil heights which had been returned in Jul 1965, a limited offensive in the Tithwal Sector and
most importantly, the capture of Haji Pir Pass in a daring operation by 1 PARA by Major (later
Lieutenant General) Ranjit Singh Dayal under 68 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier (later
Lieutenant General) ZC Bakshi on 28 August 1965. This was one of the most notable
achievements of the riposte. The capture of Haji Pir and loss of key positions in the Kishenganga
Bulge were a severe setback for the Pakistanis which put them in a state of shock. Thus, by the
end of August 1965, Pakistan’s plans for quick annexation of the Valley had been squarely
defeated.

The failure of Operation Gibraltar saw the last Phase, Operation Grand Slam put into effect by
General Ayub Khan on 01 September 1965. Pakistan did not call off Operation ‘Grand Slam'
despite the security council's call for an immediate cease-fire on 4 September 1965. It even carried
out an air raid on Amritsar the next day. The Indian warning that an attack against Jammu and
Kashmir would be treated as an attack against India was also ignored by Pakistan. Meanwhile,
apprehending a Pakistani attack, India had also formulated a contingency plan to meet the situation
militarily. The Indian plan visualised a limited offensive intended to cover the area from Dera
Baba Nanak in the North to the Sutlej in the South.Punjab Theatre: 1965 Indo Pak War

The objective of the retaliatory Indian plan was to threaten Lahore, drive a wedge between the
Pakistani forces deployed in the Lahore and Sialkot sectors and destroy their war potential. The
offensive was to serve the dual purpose of ensuring the security of Punjab by advancing the Indian
defence line to the Ichhogil Canal and to capture some Pakistani territory to serve as a bargaining
lever in the political parleys, on the conclusion of hostilities.
In view of the above plan, XI Corps under Lieutenant General JS Dhillon was assigned the tasks
on August 1965 to destroy the enemy forces which might enter Punjab and Ganganagar Sector in
Rajasthan. Also, on orders from Lieutenant General Harbaksh Singh, GOC-in-C Western
Command, the Corps was to undertake the following measures simultaneously:
a. To advance to the Ichhogil Canal along the axes GT road, Bhikkiwind-Khalra and
Bhikkiwind-Khem Karan, to secure Pakistani territory from opposite Ranian inclusive toits junction with Dipalpur Canal opposite Hussainiwala. Also to capture intact Ichhogil
Uttar road bridge, GT road bridge, Jallo road bridge and Barki Bridge on Ichhogil Canal
b. To eliminate the Pakistani bridge-head at the Dera Baba Nanak and if possible, capture the
bridge on the Ravi River, intact.
The initial task of XI Corps was to secure the East bank of the Ichhogil Canal and establish
bridgeheads across the Canal at some points. Surprise was achieved and the three Indian Divisions
gained notable success. In the South, 4 Mountain Division, under Maj Gen Gurbakhsh Singh,
launched an attack on the Khem Karan-Kasur axis and succeeded in capturing all its objectives,
either wholly or partially, by 1230 hours on 06 September. Further North, 7 Infantry Division,
under Maj Gen H K Sibal, captured Hudiara by 1030 hours. 15 Infantry Division under Maj Gen
Niranjan Prasad achieved some early success. One of its Battalions, 3 JAT crossed the Ichhogil
Canal at Dograi and reached Batapore on the outskirts of Lahore. Another Battalion of the Division
advanced upto the road bridge over this Canal near Bhaini Dhilwal, 9 km North of Dograi. The
bridge over the Ravi River at Dera Baba Nanak was captured by 29 Infantry Brigade. These
attacks, launched with speed and vigour, jolted Pakistan.

the Canal Track Junction (exclusive) to the Canal junction near Bedian (inclusive). In carrying out
the task, priority was to be given to the capture and holding of the bridge over the Ichhogil Canal
at Barki, and to deny any ingress through Bedian. One battalion was to be left for the defence of
the Hussainiwala bridge, and it was to come under the command of 7 Infantry Division on arrival.
The boundary between 7 Infantry Division and 4 Mountain Division was to be the Canal Junction-
Patti-Sirhali Kalan.
7 Infantry Division was tasked to advance along the Khalra-Barki axis. The International Border
between India and Pakistan cut this axis just 1.6 km North West of Khalra, which was inside India.
On the way to Lahore, the Upper Bhuchar Distributary and the Hudiara Drain both running at right
angles to the road, were the two major obstacles. The Ichhogil was the third and most formidable
obstacle, and Barki was located about 500 m to the East of it. The Operation Plan of 7 Infantry
Division was to be carried out in two phases;
Phase I
(a) Capture of the bridge at Barki by 48 Infantry Brigade Group by last light on 06 September.
(b) Blocking the Pakistani ingress through Bedian by 17 RAJPUT
by last light on 06 September.
(c) After the capture of the Hudiara Drain, 65 Infantry Brigade to send one Infantry Battalion to
destroy the bridge over the Ichhogil near the Hir village.
Phase II
Mopping up along the east bank of the Ichhogil in its area of responsibility, and the destruction of
all crossings over the Canal by 65 Infantry Brigade Group.4

Preliminary operations for the capture of the Posts held by the Pakistan’s Sutlej Rangers at the
Theh Sarja Marja, Rakh Hardit Singh and Ghawindi Barrier, commenced at 0445 Hours on 06
September. By 0515 Hours, 4 SIKH captured the first two Posts while 6/8 GORKHA RIFLES
subdued the last one. Thereafter, 17 RAJPUT advanced into Pakistani territory on the Wan-Bedian
axis, while 48 Infantry Brigade Group advanced astride the Khalra-Barki Road, with 6/8
GORKHA RIFLES in the lead.
The leading elements of 48 Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier K J S Shahaney, contacted
Pakistani defences at Hudiara at about 0700 Hours on 06 September. They came under heavy,
long-range automatic fire from Pakistani positions at Hudiara, Nurpur and Hudiara Drain. By this
time, 17 RAJPUT under the command of Lieutenant Colonel AS Gill, had captured the Pakistani
Border Post East of Bedian, achieving complete surprise. It was, however, halted about 550 m to
the East of the Bedian Bridge, when the defenders opened up with artillery, tanks and MMGs. The
Corps Commander then ordered GOC 7 Infantry Division to mine the 17 RAJPUT area and prevent
Pakistani ingress from Bedian at any cost. The preparations for the attack on Hudiara continued
despite heavy artillery and automatic fire. By 1030 hours, 6/8 GORKHA RIFLES, under thecommand of Lt Col G A Nagle, secured the Hudiara village, but could not attack the Hudiara
Drain, in the face of accurate artillery and small arms automatic fire.

The preparations for the attack on Hudiara continued despite heavy artillery and automatic fire.
By 1030 Hourrs, 6/8 GORKHA RIFLES, under the command of Lt Col GA Nagle, secured
the Hudiara village, but could not attack the Hudiara Drain, in the face of accurate artillery and
small arms automatic fire. It was expected that the capture of the area behind the Hudiara village
would ensure the collapse of the resistance, which had been holding up 6/8 Gorkha Rifles. The
task was entrusted to 5 GUARDS and they attacked Nurpur at 1330 Hours on 06 September. Thedefenders brought down accurate automatic and artillery fire, but the Guardsman remained
undeterred.
It was during this attack on the 06 September 1965, Guardsman Dambar Bahadur Chettri was
seriously wounded in the chest by enemy Medium Machine Gun fire. Despite his wounds, he kept
on encouraging his men and rushed forward in the face of intensive enemy mortar and MMG fire
which again wounded him seriously. He was hit a third time by enemy automatic fire in the left
shoulder and hand, but he staggered on to the objective and firing his weapon, inflicted heavy
casualties on the enemy. After the final assault and capture of the objective, he dropped dead.

Regiment recruits its soldiers from the five Southern states – Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh,
Telangana, and Karnataka. The valour of the Madras Regiment was seen when it fought fierce
battles during most military operations of independent India. Their regimental war cry is “Veer

To ease Pakistan's pressure on Chhamb, India opened a second front in Sialkot Sector. It was
strategically a vital area and a threat to it was likely to hurt Pakistan most. Loss of Sialkot would
have made Pakistan's position in Chhamb untenable and therefore, any Indian move in that
direction would have created a great scare in Pakistan. On the other hand, it would have served the
Indian interest very well indeed. This second diversionary move was launched by I corps, led by
Lieutenant General PO Dunn, on 08 September, 1965.

The Operations in Samba-Jammu-Sialkot Sector covered the area between the Ravi and the
Chenab Rivers, with the Indo-Pak border running close to the foothills in the East. The road-link
between J&K and the rest of India runs through a narrow stretch of the lower foothills, parallel to
the border. The International Border is 28 km from Jammu and 14 km from Sialkot, a major
Pakistani communication centre. Sialkot was connected with Lahore by rail via Wazirabad-
Gujranwala, and also via Pasrur-Narowal and Pakistani supplies to the Chhamb sector passed
through it. The Sialkot- Pasrur stretch of this railway line was a vital link in the Pakistani defence
system. Chawinda was a small town of strategic importance on the Sialkot- Pasrur railway line.
HQ I Corps under Lieutenant General PO Dunn had been located at Kaluchak (neař Jammu) by 04
September. Troops made available to the Corps included the following:

Madras. Thus, the Madras Regiment is one of the oldest Regiments of the Indian Infantry. The
Regiment recruits its soldiers from the five Southern states – Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh,
Telangana, and Karnataka. The valour of the Madras Regiment was seen when it fought fierce
battles during most military operations of independent India. Their regimental war cry is “Veer
madrassi, adi kollu, adi kollu, adi kollu” meaning “O brave Madrassi, hit and kill, hit and kill, hit
and kill.” In glorious 265 Years of its existence, the Regiment has a total 45 Battle Honours, 14
Theatre Honours, 11 COAS unit","s, 52 GOC-in-C Unit Appreciations, 5 UN Force
Commander Citations, one Ashoka Chakra, five Mahavir Chakra, 11 Kirti Chakra, 36 Vir Chakra,
49 Shaurya Chakra, and many other gallantry and distinguished awards.The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and Indian frontiers with Pakistan have remained a
sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at
several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of
Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with commendable bravery and steely
resilience, but always with great restrain to not escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak War of 1965
was the second war fought between these two bordering countries. While India was still recovering
from the damages of Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu
and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms of defence preparation. The war
initiated on 24 April 1965, when Pakistan Army, attacked our territory in the Rann of Kutch and
penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian
territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak Border Agreement 1960 and international law as per the
United Nations Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of
Operation Gibraltar.

in-kutch-and-kashmir-13065762.htmlThe infiltration of the Gibraltar Force at various points across the 750-km long Cease-fire Line
and the International Border between Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir began on 05 August 1965.
It covered areas of Jammu, Punch and Uri in the west, Tithwal in the North-West, Guraiz in the
North and Kargil in the North-East. Initially, about 1,500 infiltrators crossed over in small batches,
and concentrated at selected points inside Kashmir to organise themselves into larger groups. They
were equipped with light automatic weapons and their aim, apart from sabotage, was to
indoctrinate the Kashmiris so that they could revolt against India.1 The period of the infiltration
campaign was characterised by intense, hectic activity throughout the J&K Theatre with special
emphasis in the Valley. The raiders and own forces marched and counter-marched all over the
inhospitable terrain in a vast grim game of hide and seek. Several times during the day the
opponents met, clashed and reeled apart in a series of bloody actions, weaving a confused pattern
hard to unravel.2
The second batch of infiltrators, comprising some 6000 men, was pushed into Jammu and Kashmir
in the third week of August. Taking into account the replacements for those who ""exfiltrated"", it
is estimated that on the whole, about 8,000 infiltrators participated in these operations. By the first
week of September 1965, a third batch of infiltrators, approximately 5,500 strong, was ready in
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent across the border due to the
counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.3 The plan failed with their early detection and lack
of support from the locals, who gave away their positions. In sheer desperation, Pakistan also
employed its artillery in support of guerrilla operations in the Chhamb area. India grasped the
criticality of the ongoing plan, repulsed the attacks and cut off the entry and exit points into the
Kashmir Valley. A quick and firm response by India took Pakistan by surprise and thwarted their
well laid out plans.
To ease Pakistan's pressure on Chhamb, India opened a second front in Sialkot Sector. It was
strategically a vital area and a threat to it was likely to hurt Pakistan most. Loss of Sialkot would
have made Pakistan's position in Chhamb untenable and therefore, any Indian move in that
direction would have created a great scare in Pakistan. On the other hand, it would have served the
Indian interest very well indeed. This second diversionary move was launched by I Corps, led by
Lieutenant General PO Dunn, on 08 September, 1965.

The Operations in Samba-Jammu-Sialkot Sector covered the area between the Ravi and the
Chenab Rivers, with the Indo-Pak border running close to the foothills in the East. The road-link
between J&K and the rest of India runs through a narrow stretch of the lower foothills, parallel to
the border. The International Border is 28 km from Jammu and 14 km from Sialkot, a major
Pakistani communication centre. Sialkot was connected with Lahore by rail via Wazirabad-
Gujranwala, and also via Pasrur-Narowal and Pakistani supplies to the Chhamb sector passed
through it. The Sialkot- Pasrur stretch of this railway line was a vital link in the Pakistani defence
system. Chawinda was a small town of strategic importance on the Sialkot- Pasrur railway line.
HQ I Corps under Lieutenant General PO Dunn had been located at Kaluchak (neař Jammu) by 04
September. Troops made available to the Corps included the following:
a) 1 Armoured Division (Major General Rajinder Singh, MVC)
b) 6 Mountain Division (Major General SK Korla, DSO, MC)
c) 14 Infantry Division (Major General RK Ranjeet Singh)
d) 26 Infantry Division (Major General ML Thapan)
I Corps was assigned the task of securing area Pagowal (Bhagowal), Phillora (Phillaurah),
Chawinda, and the Cross Roads with a view to advancing towards the Marala-Ravi Link Canal,and eventually to the line of Dhallewali-Wuhilam-Daska-Mandhali. The operation was code-
named 'Operation Nepaľ.
By last light on 07 September, I Corps had made all preparations to cross the International Border
on a frontage extending from Degh Nadi to Suchetgarh. All formations were deployed as per the
plan, except for 14 Infantry Division, as its 58 Infantry Brigade, deployed at Madhopur Road
Bridge and the Headworks, could not be relieved. 28 Infantry Brigade, which had been allocated
to 6 Mountain Division, also could not join as it was deeply involved in Chhamb Sector. At 2300
hours on the night of 07/08 September, 6 Mountain Division and 26 Infantry Division crossed the
International Border into Pakistan. 'Operation Nepal' was on the move.4

Charwa village, the objective assigned to 99 Mountain Brigade, was a built-up area. The Brigade
appreciating that assault on the village would be hazardous during the hours of darkness, selected
objectives on the flanks for initial attack. At 2030 hours on 07 September, two companies of 6

RAJPUTANA RIFLES was successful in neutralising the opposition of a Rifle Company, and a
Company of Mujahids. The opposition was cleared by both the Battalions by 0300 hours, well
ahead of the schedule. Exploiting further, the Battalions pushed forward beyond their objectives
to cover the roads coming to Charwa from Maharajke, Chobara and Ikhnal (Nakhnal) The battle
for the village of Charwa was a grim one as it was a formidable stronghold fortified with elaborate
defensive works including an intricate network of underground tunnelling. Moreover, the
defenders fought with courage and determination. Though the main opposition was overcome by
5 GARHWAL RIFLES on the night of the attack itself, pockets of resistance lingered on for
another two days.
The attack on Maharajke by 69 Mountain Brigade was planned in two phases. In Phase I, 3
MADRAS and 9 KUMAON, were to capture the right half of the objective and block the road to
Pagowal/Badiana and Sialkot. In Phase II, 4 MADRAS was to capture the left half of the objective,
and block the road to Charwa and Zafarwal. By 1700 hours on 07 September, two Companies of
4 MADRAS secured the Forming Up Place to the South-East of Jabwal Kalan. At 2250 hours 3
MADRAS and 9 KUMAON formed up and launched the operation at 2300 hours. The right half
of the objective was secured against light enemy opposition (company plus) by 0130 hours. Phase
II of the operation was launched by 4 MADRAS at 0300 hours. But soon heavy MMG and small
arms fire held up the assault. At this stage, Lieutenant Colonel HL Mehta, the Commanding
Officer, rushed forward to lead the assault and the objective was secured by 0530 hours. In this
battle, Lieutenant Colonel Mehta led one of his reserve Companies in person. Inspired by his
presence in the in a tactically sound outflanking move. foremost line of attack, the men pressed

Pakistan. He was commissioned into the 18 Rajputana Rifles on 15 December 1957. During the
1965 Indo-Pak war, Major Ram Swarup Sharma was awarded the Vir Chakra for conspicuous
bravery and courage. He later settled in Hoshiarpur, Punjab.
The RAJPUTANA RIFLES is the senior most Rifle Regiment of the Indian Army. Its first
Battalion was raised in January 1775. The RAJPUTANA RIFLES has a long and glorious
history. The Regiment took part in some of the bloodiest battles in many theatres of the world.
During World War II, the Battalions of this Regiment fought in every theatre in which the
Indian Army was involved. Three of them, the 1st, 4th and Medium Machine Gun Battalions
fought in Eritrea in North Africa and Italy as part of the famous 4th Indian Division, whose
fighting record was one of the finest in World War II. Post-Independence the Regiment took
part in many battles and operations including the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Congo. The
Rajputana Rifles fought gallantly in the 1965 and 1971 India Pakistan wars. During the 1965
Indo-Pak war, the RAJPUTANA RIFLES displayed exemplary valour and determination
especially in the Khem Karan Sector.
The genesis of the Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu
and Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our frontiers with
Pakistan have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing,
incursions and intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive
measures. These attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with
commendable bravery and steely resilience, but always with great restraint to not escalate the

Indian territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory.
This act of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of the Indo-Pak Border
Agreement ,1960 and the international law as per the United Nations Charter. The Pakistani
forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation Gibraltar. The 1965 War
was fought in various Sectors including in Khem Karan which was the area of responsibility of
4 Infantry Division and 2 (Independent) Armoured Brigade.
Historians consider this to be the greatest tank battle since the Battle of Kursk, fought during
World War II– The Battle of Asal Uttar, a pivotal engagement in the 1965 India-Pakistan war,
unfolded from September 8 to September 10, 1965. Positioned near Khem Karan, the Indian
resistance played a crucial role in shifting the balance of power in India’s favour during the
conflict. The Pakistani Army’s Battle Group, composed of the 1st Armoured Division and 11
Infantry Division, had crossed the International Border, and captured the Indian town of Khem
Karan.
Recognizing the seriousness of the situation, the Major General Gurbaksh Singh, General
Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 4 Mountain Division ordered the Division to withdraw and
establish “Horse Shoe” shaped defensive position centered on Asal Uttar. Three Indian Army
units, namely the 18 RAJPUTANA RIFLES, 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES, and 4 GRENADIERS,
were strategically positioned to cover three axes leading to Khem Karan, providing depth to the
1/9 GORKHA RIFLES. The 9 JAK RIFLES were deployed in the rear, while the Deccan Horse
commanded by Lieutenant Colonel (later General) AS Vaidya, was positioned ahead, to the
South East of the Division’s defences. In a well-executed tactical manoeuvre, Indian troops
breached the Rohi canal at night, flooding the sugarcane fields. When morning came, the M-7and M-48 Patton tanks of the 1st Armoured Division of Pakistan were lured into the horse-shoe
shaped defensive position with the intention of overwhelming Indian defences. However, the
swampy terrain slowed down the advance of the Pakistani tanks, which ultimately became
immobilized in the muddy slush.
Asal Uttar, a village in Punjab's Tarn Taran District, bears witness to the Battle of 1965 through
its collection of memorials. These structures, both grand and modest, dot the landscape, serving
as the sole remnants of the fierce tank battle fought between Indian and Pakistani armies. Each
monument holds stories of courage, camaraderie, and sacrifice—a poignant testament to those
who defended their homeland against insurmountable odds. They stand as eternal reminders of
the legacy of the Battle of Asal Uttar, forever etched in history's pages.
The battle of Asal Uttar unfolded when Pakistani forces captured Khem Karan town, only to be
pushed back by the 4 Mountain Division and ultimately decimated by the 2nd Armoured
Brigade of the Indian Army in a decisive battle between 08 and 10 September 1965.
On 20 September, enemy tank activity was noticed at Lakhna and village Kalia to its North. The
purpose of this activity around Lakhna was not clear. Enemy tanks, mainly Chaffees of the
Reconnaissance Regiment would make an appearance, and on seeing the Centurion tanks, would
hurriedly withdraw. No apparent tactics were displayed. The Centurions would drive out the
Chaffee tanks as they would in a beat during shikar (hunt).
On 21 September, in one such beat by A Squadron under Surish Vadera, two Patton tanks were
destroyed. Suddenly, from an unexpected direction, enemy tank fire opened up. No. 1 and 2
Troop of A Squadron under Capt RK Pandit, who had reported for duty the previous day,
charged towards the enemy with 4 Troop giving fire support. The tanks of Captain Pandit and
Second Lieutenant Baldev Bhangoo were hit and on fire but fortunately the crew managed to
bale out unhurt. Two days before the ceasefire in 1965, the team of then Major Ram Swarup
Sharma in the Khemkaran sector spotted some movement on the enemy side. A patrol came
under heavy fire but the force decided to go for the kill. To fool the enemy, they advanced
raising their battle cry one after the other to reflect big numbers. Four MMGs were firing at
them. Just 200 meters from the enemy, their cover was given away and bullets rained on the
bajra field where they lay hidden. But as they kept advancing while raising the slogan, the fire
started reducing. The plan had worked; the enemy fled and its guns, ammunition, and wireless
sets were seized. The captured post was a battalion headquarters. Two tanks were also
destroyed.Lt Col Ram Swarup Sharma

Rohtak District Haryana. Following the footsteps of his father, he too joined the Army. He was
enrolled into the 3 JAT on 20 May 1940. During the 1965 Indo-Pak war, Subedar Pale Ram was
awarded the Vir Chakra for conspicuous bravery and courage.
The JAT Regiment is one of the oldest Regiments of the Indian Army. It is an Infantry
Regiment that claims its origins to the Calcutta Native Militia raised in 1795, which later
became an Infantry Battalion of the Bengal Army. Jat people were historically considered to be
martial class and were enlisted in the British Army when the policy on class regiments came. In
1922, during the grouping of the class Regiment the 9 Jat Regiment was formed by bringing
under a single Regiment, four active Battalions and one Training Battalion. In the Post-
Independent era, the JAT Regiment has lived up to their reputation and holds the distinction of
fighting in all the wars that India fought since its independence including the IPKF to Sri Lanka.
Their battle cry: Jat Balwan, Jai Bhagwan was adopted in 1955. 17 JAT received “Unit","” from the Chief of the Army Staff, General VP Malik for their conspicuous courage in
the Kargil War.

Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation Gibraltar.
Dograi is a small town in Pakistan along the Amritsar-Lahore Road, and serves as the gateway
to Lahore, located just 13 km North East. Due to its strategic position, it was fiercely defended.
The 54 Infantry Brigade of the Indian Army was assigned to capture Dograi. Despite earlier
attempts by two Indian Army Battalions, success was elusive. Ultimately, the 3 JAT
commanded by Lieutenant Colonel (later Brigadier) Desmond Hayde, part of the same Brigade,
was entrusted with capturing this crucial town, which was positioned on both sides of the
Ichhogil canal, a significant water barrier.
3 JAT, backed by Divisional Artillery, planned a significant flanking manouvre covering 6000
yards to seize Dograi from the North. On 21 September, 3 JAT carried out extensive patrolling

On 21 September, 3 JAT carried out extensive patrolling to gather intelligence on Dograi, which
was to be attacked in the night. It was discovered that the Pakistanis were well entrenched,
""some huddled over Machine Guns in pill-boxes and others tucked into the buildings of Dograi
behind Light Machine Guns and Rifles, with reserves of ammunition and grenades at hand""""
With two Light Machine Guns in each Infantry Section, ""their automatic fire was going to spew
forth from every 30 to 50 yards of front while Artillery and Mortar shells were going to raindown"""" Further, there were mine-fields and wire entanglements. The town itself was guarded by
reinforced concrete pill-boxes around its three approaches.
The Forming Up Place was just 400 meters short of the nearest Pakistani trench and to reach it,
3 JAT had to negotiate the mine-fields in a single file."" Keeping in view the Pakistani defences
the Battalion planned to attack Dograi (1100 meters North to South along the Ichhogil Canal
and 760 meters East to West) by infiltration from the North. The built-up area was divided into
four Sectors and one Sector was allotted to each Company as its objective. 'A' Company less
one Platoon secured the North-East flank of the Battalion and the Forming Up Place in the
Ruins Area.
The Battalion started from Santpura at 2330 hours on 21 September and reached the Firm Base
North of Lakhanke at 0045 hours on 22 September, after a march of 3700 meters. After a short
rest, it left the Firm Base at 0110 hours, for the Forming Up Place. D Company under Major
Vatsa, which was leading the attack, crossed the Start Line at 0150 hours on 22 September, and
after fighting through the outskirts of the town and silencing a pill-box enroute, secured the
North-East projection of the town against minor opposition.
C Company, under Major Yadav, passed through D Company to secure the North-West portion
of Dograi. Suddenly, it came under intense fire and got engaged in a fierce battle with a
company of 18 Baluch, entrenched in pill-boxes along the East bank of the Ichhogil Canal in the
Akbar School area. The Company charged the Canal bank, undaunted by the protective
minefield laid by 18 Baluch. A fierce hand to hand battle ensued inside the defended-locality
and the Baluch Company was wiped out. Subedar Pale Ram was the Platoon Commander of the
reserve Platoon with C Company. When ""C' and ""D 'Companies were engaged in hand-to-hand
fight in enemy bunkers, the reserve Platoon, headed by Subedar Pale Ram was ordered to
capture the final Company objective. Subedar Pale Ram led the attack under heavy fire from
Light Machine Gun from left and right flanks.
He himself crawled up to one Machine Gun bunker and silenced the gun by lobbing a hand
grenade. Though seriously wounded, with disregard to his own safety he made his way to
another Machine Gun bunker and destroyed it by courageously lobbing another hand-grenade
inside. Motivated by the exceptional courage and determination of Subedar Pale Ram, his
Platoon fought valiantly and captured the objective by first light on 22 September 1965.
Subedar Pale Ram received seven bullet wounds during the fight but refused evacuation till the
mopping up of the defences from bunker-to-bunker was carried out and the Tricolour hoisted
atop the highest bunker.
The depth Platoon of C Company, which was not engaged in this attack captured the North-
West projection of the town, which was the Company’s objective. Thus, the passage to Dograi
from the North-West was cleared. B Company under Major Sandhu cut through the centre of
Dograi, to secure the South-West portion of the town. It silenced a pill-box at the junction of the
GT road and Ichhogil and evicted a Platoon of 3 Baluch entrenched on the Eastern bank of the
Canal, after a severe hand to hand fight.
""A' Company under Maj Tyagi passed along the Eastern edge of Dograi, where D Company was
still fighting, to the Southern edge of the town. The Company silenced an MMG in a pill-box on
the GT road, and then fighting across the road, forced a troop of the Pakistani 23 Cavalry and
remnants of the 16 (Pak) Punjab to surrender. It also captured some mortars. Subsequently, it
came under intense automatic fire from a company of 8 (Pak) Punjab, entrenched along a pill-
box guarding the Southern approach to Dograi. In a gallant charge the pill-box was destroyed
and the defenders dislodged. In this action Major Tyagi was mortally wounded.The Battalion secured the objective by 0530 hours on 22 September, but a few pockets in
Dograi still remained to be cleared. The houses on both sides of the GT road, at the Eastern edge
of Dograi, had been turned into defensive positions. A Platoon, tasked to clear these houses,
flushed out about a dozen men from a single room. One person, who attempted to hide under a
captured tank, was dragged out. He was none other than Lieutenant Colonel GF Golewala,
Commanding Officer 16 (Pak) Punjab. In these 27 hrs of non-stop combat, the JAT’s never
paused.

After passing fifth class from the local Primary School, Chhotu Ram was enlisted in 10 JAT of
the British Indian Army on 21 August 1943. After independence, 10 JAT was re-designated as 3
JAT. During the 1965 Indo-Pak War, Naib Subedar Chhotu Ram was awarded the Vir Chakra.
The JAT Regiment is one of the oldest Regiments of the Indian Army. It is an Infantry
Regiment that claims its origins to the Calcutta Native Militia raised in 1795, which later
became an Infantry Battalion of the Bengal Army. Jat people were historically considered to be
martial class and were enlisted in the British Army when the policy on class regiments came. In
1922, during the grouping of the class Regiment the 9 Jat Regiment was formed by bringing
under a single Regiment, four active Battalions and one Training Battalion. In the post-
independent era, the JAT Regiment has lived up to their reputation and holds the distinction of
fighting in all the wars that India fought since its independence including the IPKF to Sri Lanka.
Their battle cry: Jat Balwan, Jai Bhagwan was adopted in 1955. 17 JAT received “Unit","”
from the Chief of the Army Staff, General VP Malik for their conspicuous courage in the Kargil
War.
The genesis of the Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu
and Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our frontiers with
Pakistan have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing,
incursions and intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive
measures. These attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with
commendable bravery and steely resilience, but always with great restraint to not escalate the
conflict. The Indo-Pak War of 1965 was the second war fought between these two bordering
countries. While India was still recovering from the Sino-India War of 1962, Pakistan saw it as
an opportunity to acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms
of defence preparation. The war began on 24 April 1965, when the Pakistan Army attacked
Indian territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory.
This act of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of the Indo-Pak Border
Agreement ,1960 and the international law as per the United Nations Charter. The Pakistani
forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation Gibraltar.
Dograi is a small town in Pakistan along the Amritsar-Lahore Road, and serves as the gateway
to Lahore, located just 13 km North East. Due to its strategic position, it was fiercely defended.
The 54 Infantry Brigade of the Indian Army was assigned to capture Dograi. Despite earlier
attempts by two Indian Army Battalions, success was elusive. Ultimately, the 3 JAT
commanded by Lieutenant Colonel (later Brigadier) Desmond Hayde, part of the same Brigade,
was entrusted with capturing this crucial town, positioned on both sides of the Ichhogil Canal, a
significant water barrier.
3 JAT, part of 15 Infantry Division, backed by Divisional Artillery, planned a significant
flanking manoeuvre covering 6000 yards to seize Dograi from the North. On 21 September, 3
JAT carried out extensive patrolling to gather intelligence on Dograi, which was to be attacked

The RAJPUTANA RIFLES is the senior most Rifle Regiment of the Indian Army. Its first
Battalion was raised in January 1775. The RAJPUTANA RIFLES has a long and glorious
history. The Regiment took part in some of the bloodiest battles in many theatres of the world.
During World War II, the Battalions of this Regiment fought in every theatre in which the
Indian Army was involved. Three of them, the 1st, 4th and Medium Machine Gun Battalions
fought in Eritrea in North Africa and Italy as part of the famous 4th Indian Division, whose
fighting record was one of the finest in World War II. Post-Independence the Regiment took
part in many battles and operations including the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Congo. The
Rajputana Rifles fought gallantly in the 1965 and 1971 India Pakistan wars. During the 1965
Indo-Pak war, the RAJPUTANA RIFLES displayed exemplary valour and determination

the area of responsibility of 4 Infantry Division and 2 (Independent) Armoured Brigade.
Historians consider this to be the greatest tank battle since the Battle of Kursk, fought during
World War II– The Battle of Asal Uttar, a pivotal engagement in the 1965 India-Pakistan war,
unfolded from September 8 to September 10, 1965. Positioned near Khem Karan, the Indian
resistance played a crucial role in shifting the balance of power in India’s favour during the
conflict. The Pakistani Army’s Battle Group, composed of the 1st Armoured Division and 11
Infantry Division, had crossed the International Border, and captured the Indian town of Khem
Karan.Recognizing the seriousness of the situation, the Major General Gurbaksh Singh, General
Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 4 Mountain Division ordered the Division to withdraw and
establish a “Horse Shoe” shaped defensive position centered on Asal Uttar. Three Indian Army
units, namely the 18 RAJPUTANA RIFLES, 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES, and 4 GRENADIERS,
were strategically positioned to cover three axes leading to Khem Karan, providing depth to
the 1/9 GORKHA RIFLES. The 9 JAK RIFLES were deployed in the rear, while the Deccan
Horse commanded by Lieutenant Colonel (later General) AS Vaidya, was positioned ahead, to
the South East of the Division’s defences. In a well-executed tactical manoeuvre, Indian troops
breached the Rohi canal at night, flooding the sugarcane fields. When morning came, the M-7
and M-48 Patton tanks of the 1st Armoured Division of Pakistan were lured into the horse-shoe
shaped defensive position with the intention of overwhelming Indian defences. However, the
swampy terrain slowed down the advance of the Pakistani tanks, which ultimately became
immobilized in the muddy slush.
With the Pakistani M-47 and M-48 Patton tanks approaching within 900 meters of the main
defences, the Deccan Horse, equipped with Shermans, engaged them effectively and destroyed
eleven Pakistani tanks.
A ceasefire agreement was signed by the two countries, and it was affected by 1530 hours on
23 September. But before that on 21 September, A Company 18 RAJPUTANA RIFLES was

platoon, supported by tanks and anti-tank guns. When our infantry assault began, it became
evident that the enemy had manned tanks in their positions. His Section demonstrated
remarkable skill by manoeuvring around the first tank he encountered, positioning himself
strategically, and successfully eliminating it. As the enemy retaliated with artillery and tank
fire, the Section Commander – Naik Jagdish Singh – fearlessly advanced and destroyed a
second tank. Although Lance Naik Bhanwar Singh’s Section Commander was killed in the

The infiltration of the Gibraltar Force at various points across the 750-km long Cease-fire Line
and the International Border between Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir began on 05 August
1965. It covered areas of Jammu, Punch and Uri in the west, Tithwal in the North-West, Guraiz
in the North and Kargil in the North-East. Initially, about 1,500 infiltrators crossed over in
small batches, and concentrated at selected points inside Kashmir to organise themselves into
larger groups. They were equipped with light automatic weapons and their aim, apart from
sabotage, was to indoctrinate the Kashmiris so that they could revolt against India. The period
of the infiltration campaign was characterised by intense, hectic activity throughout the J&K
Theatre with special emphasis in the Valley. The raiders and own forces marched and counter-
marched all over the inhospitable terrain in a vast grim game of hide and seek. Several timesduring the day the opponents met, clashed and reeled apart in a series of bloody actions,
weaving a confused pattern hard to unravel.
The second batch of infiltrators, comprising some 6000 men, was pushed into Jammu and
Kashmir in the third week of August. Taking into account the replacements for those who
""exfiltrated"", it is estimated that on the whole, about 8,000 infiltrators participated in these
operations. By the first week of September 1965, a third batch of infiltrators, approximately
5,500 strong, was ready in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir for induction. But it could not be sent
across the border due to the counter offensive launched by India in Punjab.
The infiltrators initially worked in small groups independently. Subsequently, in the hope of
better results, they changed their tactics and started concentrating in selected areas in larger
groups. Some infiltrators exfiltrated without participating in any operation, while some others
kept drifting till, they ran into another group and merged with it. During the later phase of the
operations, they were able to establish strongholds in some areas, mostly isolated mountainous
regions. Though the Gibraltar Force succeeded in tying down a large number of the Indian
security forces, it failed to engineer an uprising in the State. The Force did succeed in
committing some acts of sabotage and violence, but it generally failed to achieve the objectives.
The first clash with the infiltrators took place on 07 August in Sunderbani Area. On the night
of the 09/10 August 1965, a Patrol under Major Ranbir Singh of 19 PUNJAB was sent to round
up infiltrations in the Uri Sector. The Indian Army gradually realised that the infiltrators posed
a serious threat to the security of the country and that the only way to eliminate them was to go
on the offensive, cross the Cease-fire Line, and destroy their sanctuaries inside Pakistan
occupied Kashmir (PoK). Once the decision was taken, action was swift. The first step was to
recapture the three Pakistani posts on the Kargil heights, which posed a constant danger to
Srinagar-Leh Road.
The Indian Army next targeted the Haji Pir Pass, a vital link in the scheme of Pakistani
infiltration into Kashmir. The link worked as the lifeline for the saboteurs operating in the
Punch area. The Pass was dominated by three adjoining hill features - Bedori in the North-East,
Ledwali Gali in the North-West and Sank in the North. The capture of these features was
considered necessary for advancing on to Haji Pir Pass. The Haji Pir Operation was planned as
a major pincer movement involving an offensive along the general axis Uri-Haji Pir Pass and
a thrust along the Punch-Kahuta axis. It was appreciated that the link-up between these forces
would cut off all approach routes to the crucial area of the bulge. 19 Infantry Division
commanded by Major General SS Kalaan was made responsible for the thrust from the North,
with Haji Pir Pass as the objective. 68 Infantry Brigade commanded by Brigadier (later
Lieutenant General) ZC Bakshi was placed under command of the Division for the task. The
operation was given the code name OPERATION BAKSHI. The link-up operation from the
South code named 'OPERATION FAULAD' was to be launched by the 93 Infantry Brigade of
25 Infantry Division, with a minimum of two Battalions. The Pakistani strength against the 68
Infantry Brigade was estimated at three and a half Battalions.Capture of Haji Pir Pass, 25-28 August 1965

The Haji-Pir Pass was flanked by two ridges on the Eastern and Western sides. The operational
plan was to occupy the shoulders of the pass first and then moving to capture the pass itself. 19
Punjab was given the responsibility to capture the Eastern Ridge. By Second week of
September many vital areas were under Indian Army, but the Pakistanis were still holding the
Ring Counter and Point 8777, as well as strong positions around Gitian, from where they could
harass any movement on the Uri–Poonch road. Pt 8777 was two km south of the Haji Pir Pass
and Gitian one km.
During the battle for the Eastern ridge, the Charlie Company of 19 PUNJAB was tasked to
capture Point 8777 under the leadership of Major Parminder Singh. Lance Naik Lakha Singh

his rigorous training, Flying Officer Nirmal Jit joined the No 18 Squadron, known as “Flying
Bullets” in Oct 1968.1 During the Indo-Pak War of 1971, Flying Officer Sekhon flew Gnat jets
also known as “HAL Ajeet” and shot down the Pakistani Sabre which attacked the Srinagar

India gained Independence in 1947, following the partition of the country and the creation of
Pakistan. The foundation of Pakistan was laid by the Muslim League based on the two-nation
theory. Pakistan comprised two wings- East and West Pakistan which were geographically
separated by 1600 kms Indian territory. The two wings of Pakistan were culturally and
linguistically different and the diversities between the two wings could not be bridged by an

https://defencedirecteducation.com/2018/12/10/gnat-hal-ajeet/emotional appeal to religion. Consequently, fissures started erupting in the political body of
Pakistan soon after the Independence and with each passing year it widened. In the absence of
appropriate defence arrangements, the people of East Pakistan felt isolated and abandoned. Finally,
the malfeasance of Pakistani leadership during Cyclone Bhola and the overwhelming support for
the Awami League in the 1970 elections, proved the proverbial last straw on the camel’s back.3
The Awami League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (of East Pakistan) secured an absolute
majority in the general elections held in December 1970. This entitled the League to form a
Government in Pakistan. However, Pakistan’s military rulers denied this democratic right to the
Awami League in connivance with the PPP, led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. This arbitrary act of
government caused deep resentment among the population of East Pakistan resulting in
widespread protests. When the slide became unmanageable, the Pakistani rulers resorted to a
midnight crackdown on 25 March 1971. The government ordered a military crackdown and
repression wherein, the Pakistan army under Lieutenant General Tikka Khan unleashed a reign of
terror and massacred thousands of Bengalis in a genocide code-named ‘Operation Searchlight’.
Pakistan launched its attack against India on 03 December 1971. The Indo-Pak War of 1971 was
the first war when the Indian Government engaged all three services on a large scale.

As the tension mounted along the Indo-Pak borders, violations of the Indian Air Space by PAF
became very frequent. In November 1971, ten major air violations had taken place in areas around
Srinagar, Amritsar, Jammu, Jamnagar and Ganganagar. In the Eastern sector, on 22 November
3 The India-Pakistan War of 1971: A History. S.N Prasad and U.P. Thapliyal. (2014). Natraj Publishers and Ministry of
Defence, India1971, three PAF F-86 Sabres were shot over Boyra. On 03 December at 1745 hrs, the PAF
simultaneously attacked Indian airfields at Amritsar, Srinagar, Avantipur and Pathankot, the
Advance Landing Ground (ALG) at Faridkot and the radar unit at Amritsar. In the Eastern sector,
the IAF achieved total air superiority within the first 24 hours of the outbreak of hostilities. The
first heli-borne operation was undertaken by the IAF in 1971 when it heli-lifted 4/5 GORKHA
RIFLES and landed them at Sylhet nearly 100 kilometres behind enemy lines. IAF also helped in
air bridging the innumerable water obstacles crisscrossing the countryside. The effective
coordination and cooperation among the tri-services sealed the Indian victory in this war. In the
Western sector, Srinagar was one of the airfields very frequently attacked by the Pakistani Air
Force. No.18 SQUADRON was assigned its air defence. On 14 December 1971, the airfield was
attacked by six Pakistani Sabre jets. Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon got airborne and
engaged the Sabre formation.
Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon was a pilot with a Gnat detachment posted in Srinagar for
the valley's air defence against Pakistani air strikes. Until the commencement of hostilities with
Pakistan, no air defence aircraft were based at Srinagar, in compliance with an international
agreement dating back to 1948. As a result, Flying Officer Sekhon was unfamiliar with the
landscape and was unaccustomed to the altitude of Srinagar, particularly with the terrible cold and
piercing winds of the Kashmir winter. Nonetheless, he and his colleagues fought consecutive
waves of invading Pakistani aircraft with gallantry and commitment from the start of the conflict,
preserving the Gnat aircraft's strong reputation. On 14 December 1971, a wave of six enemy Sabre
aircraft assaulted Srinagar Airfield. However, Flying Officer Sekhon was unable to take off
immediately due to dust clouds created by another aircraft that had just taken off. By the time the
runway was ready for takeoff, six enemy planes were overhead, and the airfield was being strafed.
Despite the dangers of attempting to take off during an attack and the odds stacked against him,
Flying Officer Sekhon took off and engaged two of the attacking Sabres right away. In the combat
that ensued, he almost held his own at tree-top height, but was eventually defeated by the sheer
weight of numbers. He was killed when his plane crashed. Flying Officer Sekhon achieved his
goal by sacrificing himself for the defence of Srinagar because the enemy aircraft abandoned the
scene of the combat without pressing their attack against the town and the base. Flying Officer
Sekhon's courage, supreme valour, flying talent, and commitment, above and beyond the call of
duty, set new standards for Air Force traditions.Mrs Sekhon receiving the Param Vir Chakra from the then President of India V.V

(Effective date of award: 14 December 1971)
Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon was a pilot of a Gnat detachment based at Srinagar for the
air defence of the valley against Pakistani air attacks. In accordance with the international
agreement dating back to 1948, no air defence aircraft were based at Srinagar, until the outbreak
of hostilities with Pakistan. Flying Officer Sekhon was, therefore, unfamiliar with the terrain and
was not acclimatised to the altitude of Srinagar, especially with the bitter cold and biting winds of
the Kashmir winter. Nevertheless, from the outset of the war, he and his colleagues fought
successive waves of intruding Pakistani aircraft with valour and determination, maintaining the
high reputation of the Gnat aircraft. On 14th December 1971, Srinagar Airfield was attacked by a
wave of six enemy Sabre aircraft. Flying Officer Sekhon was on readiness duty at the time.
However, he could not take off at once because of the clouds of dust raised by another aircraft
which had just taken off. By the time the runway was fit for take-off, no fewer than six enemy
aircraft were overhead, and strafing of the airfield was in progress. Nevertheless, in spite of the
mortal danger of attempting to take off during an attack, and in spite of the odds against him.
Flying Officer Sekhon took off and immediately engaged a pair of the attacking Sabres. In the
fight that followed, at tree-top height, he all but held his own, but was eventually overcome by
sheer weight of numbers. His aircraft crashed and he was killed. Thus, sacrificing himself for the
defence of Srinagar, Flying Officer Sekhon achieved his object, for the enemy aircraft fled from
the scene of the battle without pressing home their attack against the town and the airfield. The
sublime heroism, supreme gallantry, flying skill and determination, above and beyond the call of
duty, displayed by Flying Officer Sekhon in the face of certain death, set new heights to Air Force
traditions.

the Indo-Pak War of 1965, he was serving as a Fireman with the Northern Railway. He worked in
Gurdaspur Railway Station as a Fireman and was with a goods train transporting diesel and oil.
The Indo-Pak war of 1965 was the second war fought between these the two bordering countries.
While India was still recovering from the damages of Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as
an opportunity to acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak in terms
of defence preparation. The war was initiated on 24 April 1965, when Pakistan Army attacked our
territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This act
of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak Border Agreement 1960
and international law, as per the United Nations Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently
intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation Gibraltar.
The role of the civilians during the Indo-Pak War of 1965 was very crucial to the prospects of the
war. From mule drivers to local villagers, from truck drivers to railway men, the civilians
performed their duty with utmost devotion, ignoring all dangers. Among the contribution of the
civilians, one of the most crucial roles during the Indo-Pak War of 1965 was performed by the
railway men. They were entrusted with the duty of the keeping the rail lines operational to deliver
the supplies on time. One of them was Chaman Lal who was working at Gurdaspur Railway
Station.
On 13 September 1965, a goods train at Gurdaspur Station on the Amritsar-Pathankot section of
the Northern Railway was heavily strafed by Pakistani planes. Three tank wagons carrying diesel
oil caught fire and exploded. Chaman Lal, the train's fireman, noticed the fire and foresaw the
imminent tragedy. With utter disregard to his personal safety, he rushed to the scene and uncoupled
the tank wagons impacted by the fire. He had hardly finished this perilous task when he was
engulfed by the flames of the blazing tank and burned to death. Due to Chaman Lal’s daring act in
which he sacrificed his life, the remaining wagons of the train could be taken to safety. His
extraordinary act, foresight and initiative, not only saved the remaining wagons and valuable
cargo, but also saved the lives of many people present at the railway station.
Chaman Lal’s fearless act and supreme self-sacrifice will be remembered as a shining example of
bravery and selfless devotion to service. He was awarded Ashoka Chakra (Posthumous).","Chaman Lal, Fireman, Northern Railway (Posthumous).

On 13th September 1965, a goods train at Gurdaspur Station on Amritsar-Pathankot section of
Northern Railway was subjected to heavy strafing by Pakistani planes, as a result of which 3 tank
wagons carrving diesel oil caught fire and one of them exploded. Shri Chaman LaL, Fireman of

with complete disregard for his personal safety, uncoupled the tank wagons affected by the fire.
Hardly had he completed this dangerous operation when he was enveloped by the flames of the
burning tank and was burnt to death. As a result of his courageous action in which he sacrificed
his life, the other wagons of the train could be removed to safety. By his exemplary courage,
foresight, initiative and complete disregard of his personal safety, Shri Chaman Lai not only
prevented the destruction of the remaining wagons and valuable stores, but also saved the lives of
many persons present at the Railway Station. His supreme self-sacrifice will remain a shinning

(Effective date of the award-05 September 1986)
On September 5, 1986, Smt Neerja Mishra was a member of crew of the Pan American Airways
flight from Bombay to New York via Karachi, as Senior Flight Purser. At Karachi airport a
group of four heavily armed hijackers rushed to the aircraft on the tarmac. Showing great
presence of mind and quick reflexes, she shouted ""Hijack"". This alerted the flight crew who
immediately escaped, thereby immobilising the aircraft.
With the exit of the flight crew, she took command of the situation and helped keep the terrified
passengers calm. She deftly managed the situation and prevented the trigger-happy hijackers
from going berserk. When the power in the aircraft went off suddenly, she helped a number of
passengers to escape through the emergency door. Now she became a marked target for the
hijackers. One of these criminals grabbed her from behind and shot her dead. Her loyalty to the
passengers of aircraft in distress was of an exceptional order indeed.
Smt Neerja Mishra displayed exceptional courage in the face of the grave adversity and saved
many lives, unmindful of the safety of her own life. In recognition of this act of most
conspicuous bravery she was awarded Ashoka Chakra Posthumously.

Narayan Rao Samant, in his grandmother’s home in Vasai, north of Mumbai. His father,
Narayan Rao Samant, was a Viceroy’s Commissioned Officer in the Indian Army. Subedar
Major Samant’s family hailed from Parule Village in Sindhudurg District, along the Konkan
Coast in Bombay state. Commander Samant was the eldest of the five children. Commander
Samant studied at Wilson College in Mumbai, where he passed the Intermediate Science
Examination. He was commissioned into the Indian Navy on 01 January 1952, after which he
underwent basic training at the Royal College at Dartmouth and Greenwich. Six years later,
in 1958, Commander Samant again went to the United Kingdom (UK) for the Long
Navigation and Direction Course. One of the important events in his career was the
Expedition “Survival” of 1960. It involved sailing on a cutter from Vishakhapatnam to Port
Blair and back to Madras braving many storms on the rough seas.
In 1965, Commander Samant underwent submarine training in the UK, thereafter he was sent
to Russia, where he spent two years. Commander Samant commissioned India’s first
submarine, INS Karanj, in 1969 and commanded the submarine till the end of 1970. He has
also served aboard INS Amba, and INS Vikrant.
The third India-Pakistan war began on December 03, 1971, when the Pakistan Air Force
launched pre-emptive air strikes against Indian airbases. The war was forced upon India due
to the widespread genocide of people in East Pakistan carried out by the military regime
under General Yahya Khan of Pakistan. As a result, an estimated ten million refugees took
shelter in India within a space of nine months, leading to a war between the two countries.
The Indo-Pak War of 1971 was the first war when the Indian government employed all three
services on a large scale in two theaters. The Indian Navy played a crucial role in securing
victory for India in a short and intense war fought on both the Eastern and Western fronts.

Commander Samant was an officer attached with the Eastern Naval Command. Before the
war, in April 1971, he and his team had began training over 400 Bengali College students as
maritime marine commandos. The commandos were to carry out covert maritime operations
inside Bangladesh, then East Pakistan, in support of the Bangladesh government-in-exile.
They were trained by a covert naval warfare unit — the Naval Commando Operations (X),
NCO(X), set up by Director of Naval Intelligence, Captain MK Roy, and the Navy Chief
Admiral SM Nanda. The training included carrying limpet mines that the trained commandos
could swim with on their bellies and plant on Pakistani ships.Map of the Operation

commando-operations-which-were/1678910199130500/
With the outbreak of hostilities between India and Pakistan on 03 December 1971, two Mukti
Bahini vessels arrived at the Border Security base at Hasnabad on 06 December 1971. The
Commandant of the 72 Battalion Marine Special Force, Commander HK Mukherjee fuelled,
stored and provided guides to the two Mukti Bahini vessels which were provided with
communication sailors and wireless sets. The BSF vessel, MV Chitrangada and the Naval
Seaward defence boat, INS Panvel, were added to this force.
Commander MN Samant was appointed as the senior officer of ‘Force Alpha’. The Force was
tasked with attacking the enemy targets at Mongla and Khulna. The Task Group comprised of
four vessels: INS Panvel, Mukti Bahini tugs Padma and Palash (which were converted into
gun-boats) and MV Chitrangadha, a pusher tug of the Border Security Force. Padma and
Palash were retrofitted with L-60 Bofors guns, machine guns on their bridges and had their
decks reinforced. They were manned mostly by Mukti Bahini men. MV Chitrangada was
fitted only with machine guns.INS Panvel appeared relatively more formidable due to her two 40 mm Bofors guns, despite
being one of the smallest vessels in the Poluchat Class obtained from the former USSR.
Weighing only 90 tons and measuring just 29 meters in length, it had minimal facilities, with
a single toilet, shower, and kitchen shared among all crew members. Originally manned by a
crew of 16, this was increased to 30 after the installation of the Bofors guns. Additionally, the
vessel was equipped with limpet mines, explosives, small arms, and other necessary gear for
conducting underwater sabotage, scuttling, and boarding operations.
The Force set off on 07 December 1971, from Hasnabad, a river port in India, and journeyed
through the Sunderbans Delta, covering several miles. They faced numerous challenges, such
as Pakistani teams attempting to locate them using direction-finding equipment, a lack of
precise navigation charts forcing them to rely on Indian Army Maps, and navigating through
the unfamiliar, narrow, and intricate waterways of the Sunderbans, sometimes in complete
darkness. At one point, Palash ran aground on a sandbank shortly after departure and had to
be pulled free by Padma using her tow rope.
Around 0300 hours on 08/09 December, 1971, The entire force arrived, without opposition,
at Akram Point. INS Panvel spotted two medium-sized ships attempting to flee the conflict
zone. Since these ships were faster than Panvel and were beyond the range of the force's
weapons, Commander MN Samant, the Force Commander, passed on information about them
to the Eastern Fleet (Rear Admiral SH Sharma) flying the flag on board the aircraft carrier
Vikrant. As a result, the Pakistani freighters MV Baqir and MV Anvar Baksh were
intercepted and became prizes of war. These ships were carrying Pakistani military personnel,
their families, as well as significant quantities of weapons and ammunition.
The Task Force then started heading Northwards into the Pussur River. This river was vital
for Khulna, hosting East Pakistan's largest inland port complex, Chalna-Mongla Port. These
ports played a crucial role in Pakistan's waterborne trade, generating significant government
revenue and supplying essential supplies to the heavily guarded military garrisons in Khulna
from West Pakistan via maritime routes. To maximize the element of surprise, Force Alpha
reached Mongla at dawn on 10 December.
Some senior officers of the Force landed ashore at Mongla and were cheered by a large
crowd. The Pakistani forces had already left the place and two Pakistani Naval officers had
been taken prisoner by the Mukti Bahini. Commander MN Samant then ordered Panvel,
Padma and Palash to proceed to Khulna. The fourth ship, Chitrangada, remained behind to
render assistance and search for survivors. The three ships sailed from Mongla at 0820 hours
on 10 December, and arrived at Khulna at 1120 hours.
Khulna, besides its commercial significance, was home to PNS Titumir, a crucial naval base
in East Pakistan. The besieging of Titumir would have significantly impacted the morale of
Pakistani forces in the area. As the ships moved along the Rupsha River, Pakistani soldiers
emerged from bunkers on the Western bank and opened fire on the ships with rifles and
machine guns.While the ship began silencing the enemy, three IAF Gnats appeared in the sky. Even though
the ships displayed large yellow piece of cloth on top of their bridge as identification mark,
Padma and Palash got hit by rockets. The crew abandoned the ships by diving into the water.
The third Gnat attacked Panvel but missed her narrowly. Commander Samant ordered the
ships to be abandoned.
After the Indian Air Force fighters disappeared, Commander Samant, Lieutenant Commander
Noronha, and the rest of the crew re-boarded Panvel. With effective use of her engines,
Panvel managed to free herself from being beached and resumed her journey. Samant made
the decision to turn back and rescue the survivors of Padma and Palash, who were stranded in
the river and under heavy fire from the Pakistani Army and militia. As Panvel approached to
rescue the crew, she simultaneously engaged the enemy bunkers on both riverbanks,
suppressing their fire.
During this rescue operation, a second wave of Gnats arrived, prompting Panvel to manouvre
evasively once again, ultimately avoiding further harm. After the Gnats disappeared, Panvel
continued with the rescue efforts, successfully picking up 14 crew members from Palash and
Padma by the end of the day's action.
INS Panvel proceeded to carry out the task assigned to her. During the attack on Khulna, she
came under heavy small arms and machine gun fire from buildings on either side of the
waterway, but she effectively neutralised them with the Bofors guns and small arms. As a
result, the Police HQ, Khulna shipyards steel mills, gun emplacements, fortifications were
either damaged or destroyed. After the engagement was over, the ship sailed for Hasnabad
where she arrived at 1845 hours on 11 December 1971.

Commander Mohan Narayan Rao Samant was the senior officer of force consisting of craft,
which carried out most daring and highly successful attacks on the enemy in Mongla and
Khulna ports. Manoeuvring his squadron through a most hazardous and unfamiliar route,
Commander Samant achieved complete surprise and routed the enemy in Mongla inflicting
heavy losses. Commander Samant then proceeded to attack Khulna to destroy the enemy
entrenched in strength in the port. A bitter fight ensued in which the force was subjected to
incessant air attacks. Two boats belonging to the Mukti Bahini operating with the force were
sunk. In utter disregard of his personal safety, the officer not only managed to pick up a large
number of the survivors but also persisted with fierce attacks on the enemy with devastating
results. Commander Samant had a number of narrow escapes, but refused to withdraw to
safer waters. By his personal example and high qualities of leadership, Commander Samant
inspired his men to rise to the occasion and fight most gallantly.
Throughout the operations, Commander Mohan Narayan Rao Samant displayed conspicuous
gallantry, dedication and leadership.

00022-Z,Vice Admiral (Then Captain),Swaraj Parkash,INS Vikrant,"Vice Admiral (Then Captain) Swaraj Parkash was born on 03 September 1923, to Shri
Milkhi Ram, a school teacher in Jalandhar Punjab. Captain Parkash did his early schooling
from Jalandhar. He had an excellent academic record and was sent to college in Lahore. He
appeared for and cleared the examination for recruitment to the Indian Mercantile Marine
Training Ship (IMMTS), Dufferin, and a career in the Merchant Navy, but gave up that
option and chose to join what was then the Royal Indian Navy. He had a spectacular career in
the Indian Navy, beginning as a Sub Lieutenant in World War II and retiring as Vice Chief of
Naval Staff almost four decades later, in the rank of Vice Admiral.
He specialised in navigation and commanded five ships, heading the Western Fleet and
Eastern Naval Command. In 1949, he was chosen to participate in the Long Navigation and
Direction Course and traveled to the United Kingdom. Then he served as the Flag Lieutenant
to Vice Admiral Sir William Edward Parry, Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Indian Navy.
He specialised was in navigation and direction. In December 1952, he was promoted to acting
Lieutenant Commander. In 1955, he attended the Defence Services Staff College in
Wellington and later became a member of the Directing Staff there.
Captain Parkash commanded several ships, including the Black Swan-Class Sloop INS
Krisna, the Leopard-Class Frigate INS Betwa (1959), the Blackwood-Class Frigate INS
Khukri (F149), and the Leander-Class Cruiser INS Delhi (C74). In 1965, he attended the
Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, USA. On 30 June 1967, he was promoted to
the substantive rank of Captain. He also served as the Naval Attaché at the Indian Embassy in
Moscow, working with the Ambassador of India to the USSR. Afterwards, he transferred to
Naval Headquarters and became the Director of the Submarine arm. On 26 January 1971, he
was honored with the Ati Vishisht Seva Medal.

launched pre-emptive air strikes against Indian airbases. The war was forced upon India due
to the widespread genocide of people in East Pakistan carried out by the military regime

December is celebrated as Navy Day to commemorate Operation Trident during the 1971
War.
Captain Parkash played a stellar role as the Captain of INS Vikrant during the 1971 war. He
assumed command of Vikrant in mid-1971, when war clouds loomed over the subcontinent,
but a question mark hung over the participation of Vikrant in the war. It seemed that the
aircraft carrier INS Vikrant with her Air Squadrons would not see any action as both the ship
and the aircraft were in a poor state of repair. Vikrant was non-operational with one of the
four boilers requiring replacement, limiting the speed of the ship to 14 knots against the
designed 24.5 knots. which was insufficient to operate aircraft or to deal with potentialssubmarine threats. When there is no ambient wind on the deck to provide critical buoyancy
under the wings, aircrafts need over 20 knots of carrier speed for take-off. In any event, there
would be no steam to launch the aircrafts. These infirmities in INS Vikrant directly impacted
its operations, the carrier’s availability and deployment posed a difficulty for the naval
planners. While the visionary leadership of Admiral SM Nanda and Vice Admiral N
Krishnan decided to bite the bullet and deploy the carrier in the main theatre of operations,
that is the Bay of Bengal, from June 1971 onwards, it needed someone of the calibre of
Captain Parkash to galvanise the rank and file of the ship and deliver the goods.
INS Vikrant

On board, the carrier had three Air Squadrons: INAS 300 ‘White Tigers’ with eighteen
Seahawks, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Santosh Kumar Gupta; INAS 310
‘Cobras’ with five Alizes, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Ravindra Das Dhir; and
INAS 321 ‘Angels’ with Alouette Helicopters, commanded by Lieutenant Commander V
Ravindranath. Commander Benoy Roy Chowdhury was Cdr E, the Engineering Officer of
INS Vikrant (R11), responsible for the boilers generating the steam that was essential for the
operation of the carrier.
INS Vikrant’s Cdr E, Commander Benoy Roy Chowdhury came to the rescue and fixed the
ailments of the ship. He, with Senior Engineer Lieutenant Commander B. Bhushan (later
Vice Admiral) and an excellent engineering team, confidently implemented hair-raising,
high-risk innovations, such as placing steel straps around the cracked boiler, adjusting the
safety valves to tolerate higher risks, and leaving the boiler-room unmanned but remotely
monitored when the risks were elevated. His exceptional technical skills, combined with his
ability to motivate his team, made it possible for the carrier to function effectively. All boilers
were operational. INS Vikrant sailed at speed of over 20 knots. Captain Parkash was
instrumental in getting the ship going, in backing his engineers to resolve its boiler problems
and much else through typical Indian innovations, and in working up his Air Squadrons to
perfection.
PNS Ghazi was sent by the Pakistanis to attack Vikrant. The failure of a Pakistan’s
intelligence led them to believe that the Vikrant was present in Vishakhapatnam, but inreality, Vikrant was prowling the Bay of Bengal off Cox’s Bazar. Aboard the carrier was a
complement of flying craft comprising 10 Seahawk jet planes, two Alouette Helicopters and
four Alize turboprop anti-submarine craft. At about 1100 hours on 04 December, eight of the
Seahawks ambled off the angled deck of the Vikrant towards the Cox's Bazar airfield. The
first targets were the airstrip, the hangars and the communications system. Considering that
the Pakistan Air Force in Bangladesh had not yet been immobilised it was a daring enterprise
because the Seahawks would have to face the Sabres.
After damaging the installations at Cox Bazar, all the Seahawks returned safely to their
carrier base. Later that same afternoon, they launched another mission targeting the heavily
defended Chittagong airfield. Upon spotting the small but determined enemy aircraft, the
Pakistani medium and heavy anti-aircraft guns began a fierce barrage. Despite the intense
fire, only one Seahawk sustained damage. The remaining aircraft returned to their carrier
after hitting the harbor control tower, igniting a fuel dump, and sinking two gunboats.

On 05 December, the Vikrant redirected its operations westward to Khulna, Mongla, and
Chalna. Facing intense pressure from the Indian Army and Air Force, enemy troops began
fleeing to these areas of Bangladesh, attempting to escape via sea routes. However, they soon
realised that the naval punches were the hardest.
The Seahawks had to take a big leap of 120 kilometres to reach the inland port of Khulna and
having gone so far obliged, the enemy by sinking a bunch of his gunboats inside the harbour.A rank by-stander, an armed merchant ship in the outer anchorage, presented a 'gun salute' to
the aircraft. The Seahawks returned the courtesy which was not at all to the liking of the
victims. A few small craft, tugs and port installations were also damaged.

On the fourth day of the naval battle off Bangladesh, Seahawks launched a vigorous early
morning strike, targeting the Mongla, Khulna, and Chalna areas at the mouth of the Pussur
River. In Mongla, they faced intense anti-aircraft fire from both riverbank positions and
enemy gunboats. The Seahawks responded by neutralizing the gun positions and hitting four
gunboats directly, destroying two and severely damaging the other two. In Khulna, the
aircraft encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire from an armed merchant ship. Despite this, they
were drawn to the picturesque entrance of the Pussur River, where they targeted a port
wireless transmitting station, setting it ablaze and severing all communication with the
Pakistani Naval Command in the area. In retaliation, the Pakistanis unleashed heavy anti-
aircraft fire from multiple batteries. Meanwhile, Alizes launched rockets at a merchant ship,
which was ultimately sunk.
Back in the Chittagong area that afternoon the Seahawks picked on the army barracks and
workshops and set them on fire. The usual bouquet of heavy anti-aircraft fire was sent up to
them in the air. In return the aircraft silenced the battery with their superior fire power. While
the Seahawks were pounding Chittagong during the day, the Alizes were fishing for enemy
submarines and surface ships after dusk. Taking advantage of the darkness of the night, they
screamed off the Vikrant, heading for Chittagong. Unobtrusively they reached the airport and
bombed the runway scoring several direct hits.On 07 December, Cox's Bazar was the primary target. The mission was meticulously
organized: the Seahawks, affectionately nicknamed White Tigers, focused on the airfield,
while the Alizes, also known as Cobras, targeted the fuel dumps. After completing their
objectives, our pilots proceeded to Chittagong. The Pantanga Battery did not open up as
usual. To ensure no threats were left, the Seahawks conducted rocket attacks on the Pantanga
position. The absence of response from the Battery suggested that the earlier strikes had been
effective. That evening, as they returned to their base, the pilots noticed the first signs of
imminent Pakistani surrender: Pakistani aircraft in Chittagong and Cox's Bazar were
displaying large white flags from the tops of their masts.

The war was now five days' old. Meticulous planning of every strike and every action and
successful execution of every plan was yielding rich dividends, and the Eastern Fleet was in
full command of the Bangladesh coastal air space and water front. That was what had earned
Captain Swaraj Parkash the well-deserved decoration.
The fleet was now perfectly positioned to launch an assault on Barisal, where enemy troop
concentrations had been reported. Consequently, the Alizes conducted a nighttime attack
under moonlight. During this operation, no ship movements were detected in the Tetulia,
Bighai, and Bishkali rivers within the Barisal area. However, in the subsequent wave ofattacks, the Seahawks targeted the Barisal, Bakarganj, and Patuakhali regions, where they
located and destroyed three enemy bages laden with troops, arms, and equipment.
Additionally, they successfully struck Pakistani troop concentrations and artillery positions.
Among the many ""firsts"" scored by the Navy in this war was the amphibious landing of
troops on enemy-held beaches. The landing calls for careful planning and meticulous
execution. Intensive reconnaissance of the beaches must be carried out and the gradient
ascertained before selecting the most suitable place for the landing. Above all, the coast must
be clear of the enemy.

Logistic support, including transport and heavy supplies, must be moved under the cover of
darkness to minimize the risk of detection. Special landing ships are deployed by every Navy
to handle this task. Around 13 December, reports indicated that groups of Pakistani forces
were attempting to flee into Burma via the overland route through Cox's Bazar. In response, it
was decided to land a battalion at Cox's Bazar to block and disrupt the enemy's escape route.
Unfortunately, the Navy’s landing ships were unavailable at that time, so the fleet had to rely
on the merchant ship SS Vishwavijaya to transport the battalion. The ship took the troops to a
point off the Cox's Bazar coast, where they were then transferred to regular landing ships.Prior to this, the Alizes had conducted a preliminary photo reconnaissance of the coast, which
helped in selecting a suitable landing spot. On 14 December, the beachhead area was bombed
to prepare for the landing. Subsequently, frogmen conducted a thorough search of the area.
The landing craft arrived as planned on the night of 15 December, and the first amphibious
landing of Indian troops occurred shortly thereafter.

To sum up, during the operations, the Vikrant operated in the most perilous waters and was
the primary target for both enemy submarines and aircraft. Despite these dangers, Captain
Swaraj Parkash demonstrated remarkable determination, leading relentless offensive actions
against the enemy. The air strikes launched from the Vikrant had a profoundly destructive
impact on ports along the Bangladesh coast, effectively denying the enemy access to both sea
and inland waterways. The overwhelming dominance of our naval forces, epitomized by the
Vikrant, crippled the enemy, eroded their morale, and significantly hastened their surrender
in the eastern theatre. Captain Swaraj Prakash displayed conspicuous gallantry, inspiring
leadership, professional skill and devotion to duty in keeping with the highest traditions of
the Indian Navy.White Tigers on board INS Vikrant in the Bay of Bengal, December 1971.

Captain Swaraj Parkash commanded INS Vikrant which was the nucleus of the Naval
interdiction and strike force operating against the enemy in the Bay of Bengal. Throughout
the period of those operations, the ship was operating in most hazardous waters and was the
principal target both for the enemy Submarines and Aircraft. With indomitable spirit, he
launched ceaseless offensive operations against the enemy. The successful air strikes from
the Vikrant had devastating effect on Ports all along the Bangladesh coast and completely
denied the enemy the use of sea and island waterways. The complete supremacy of our Naval
force symbolized by the Vikrant paralyzed the enemy, shattered his morale and considerably
expedited the enemy’s capitulation in the Eastern Theatre.

Commander V.C. Tomy. He was commissioned in the Indian Navy in the year 2000. In 2002, he
successfully completed his flying training, earning the qualification of a maritime reconnaissance
pilot on the Dornier 228 aircraft. In 2013, Commander Tomy achieved the distinction of being the
first Indian to accomplish a solo, non-stop circumnavigation of the world by sail. He also
participated in the 2018 Golden Globe Race. In January 2021, he made the decision to retire from
his military career in order to fully focus on preparing for the 2022 Golden Globe Race.
From a young age, Abhilash was captivated by the mysteries of the ocean. His curiosity about
circumnavigating the world was ignited after watching a Doordarshan documentary about the army
vessel 'Krishna,' which completed a global voyage with a team of six officers. Initially beginning
his career in the Navy as a pilot, Abhilash later made the transition to the world of sailing.
Sailing Career
Before embarking on his solo circumnavigation of the globe, known as Sagar Parikrama 2,
Abhilash had proudly represented India in numerous international competitions. These included
notable events such as the 2011 Cape Town to Rio Race, the Enterprise World Championships,
and the Asian Sailing Championship. His extensive experience and sailing prowess made him the
ideal candidate for Sagar Parikrama 2.
In preparation for this monumental journey, Abhilash Tomy, along with Cdr Dilip Donde, took
part in the 2011 Cape Town to Rio Race. During the return leg of the race, Tomy demonstrated his
exceptional skills by navigating double-handed from Rio to Cape Town and subsequently sailing
single-handed from Cape Town to Goa. Additionally, he undertook voyages to Malaysia and
Thailand with a crew of three.
On November 1, 2012, Abhilash Tomy embarked on an epic journey with the Mhadei, a specially
designed sailboat intended for circumnavigation, setting sail from the Gateway of India in
Mumbai. Over the course of this remarkable voyage spanning 23,100 nautical miles, he sailed
around the formidable Cape of Good Hope, Cape Horn, and Cape Leeuwin, facing the challenges
of the world's most treacherous waters.
Upon his triumphant return to Mumbai on March 31, 2013, Abhilash Tomy achieved a historic
milestone. He became not only the sole Indian but also just the second Asian and the 79th person
worldwide to accomplish the extraordinary feat of a solo, non-stop circumnavigation of the Earth.
In recognition of his remarkable achievement, a ceremonial reception was held in his honour at
the Gateway of India on April 6, 2013, with the President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee,
presiding over the event.The Golden Globe Race
The Golden Globe Race is a gruelling sailing competition that involves a non-stop, solo
circumnavigation of the world, encompassing the five Great Capes, with both the starting and
finishing points in Les Sables-d'Olonne, France. What makes this challenge particularly
demanding is that it necessitates participants to complete the circumnavigation without any stops,
and they are required to employ only the technology available before the year 1969.
Sailors in this race are strictly limited in terms of navigation tools, relying solely on a compass,
printed maps, and celestial observations to find their way across the vast oceans. Communication
is also highly restricted, as the only communication device allowed onboard is a satellite phone,
reserved solely for emergency medical situations. Tomy has described the event as ""This is
climbing Everest, without supplementary oxygen... without your clothes on. It is going back to a
very different era, there is no escape... there is no cheat... There is no help from the outside world
throughout the race ""
In 2018, Abhilash Tomy received an invitation to participate in the 50th-anniversary edition of the
Golden Globe Race (GGR), a race widely recognized as one of the most demanding tests of human
endurance in the world. Tomy embarked on the journey aboard a modest 10-metre boat named
""Thuriya."" The limited size of the boat meant there was insufficient space to store even an adequate
supply of drinking water.
Disaster at Sea
After approximately 82 days at sea, Abhilash Tomy's boat encountered a fierce storm, leading to
the dismasting and severe damage of his vessel. During this tumultuous event, he suffered a
catastrophic fall that resulted in multiple spinal fractures. Tomy vividly recounted the harrowing
moments, describing how, ""When the boat turned upright after the second knockdown, my wrist
was stuck on wires connecting the mast. At one point, the strap of my watch broke, and I fell nine
metres on a piece of aluminium called the boom. Then I fell to the deck on my back. I cleaned up
some of the broken equipment, but half an hour later, I could not stand.""
Following the severe injuries he sustained during the storm, Abhilash Tomy found himself
immobilised and facing a multitude of challenges. He was unable to eat or drink, and persistent
hiccups added to his discomfort. However, thanks to a multinational rescue effort, and with
substantial support from the Indian Navy, he was successfully rescued and received the necessary
medical attention.
Upon medical examination, doctors discovered that Tomy had endured four spine fractures. To
address these injuries, they performed a procedure to fuse five vertebrae into a single unit andinserted two titanium rods along with eight screws into his back. Following the surgery, he faced
significant physical limitations. He was unable to walk or stand, and his lung capacity was reduced.
His haemoglobin count had dropped to 50%. To move around, he relied on crutches for support
and required external assistance to get out of his bed.
After two months, with the help of therapy, he was back to his naval duty and six months later, he
was cleared to fly and sail again. Later on, in January 2021, he made the significant decision to
retire from military service, setting his sights firmly on the 2022 Golden Globe Race (GGR)
Commander Abhilash Tomy made a remarkable comeback by participating in the 2022 Golden
Globe Race, despite the immense challenges he had faced previously. Not only did Tomy survive
this gruelling race, but he also achieved a podium finish, showcasing his unwavering spirit.
Once again, the race was far from smooth sailing for Abhilash Tomy. Throughout the competition,
he had to contend with physical distress and encountered mechanical issues with his ship while
navigating through the treacherous waters.
Despite all these obstacles, his triumphant arrival at the port of Les Sables d'Olonne was a sight to
behold, underscoring his extraordinary resilience and unwavering commitment to the world of
sailing.
Conclusion
Commander Abhilash Tomy continues to play a pivotal role in India's pursuit of adventurous and
pioneering projects, spanning both maritime and aerospace domains. His expertise and experience
have led to his selection as an advisor for two ground-breaking initiatives:
Commander Tomy has been chosen as an advisor for the Indian Navy's ambitious Sagar Parikrama
IV initiative. This initiative aims to make history by sending a female naval officer on a solo sailing
expedition around the world. His guidance and insights will be invaluable in preparing and
supporting this pioneering endeavour.
He is also a part of the team collaborating with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
for Gaganyaan, India's inaugural manned space mission. His extensive expertise promises to be a
crucial asset as India sets its sights on achieving new milestones in space exploration.
Commander Abhilash Tomy's involvement in these ventures highlights his enduring commitment
to pushing the boundaries of exploration and adventure, both on Earth's oceans and beyond in the
realm of space. His contributions are instrumental in advancing India's capabilities in these
domains.","Lieutenant Commander Abhilash Tomy (04988-K)
Lieutenant Commander Abhilash Tomy circumnavigated the earth under sail, solo, nonstop and
unassisted. The degree of difficulty of his feat can be gauged by the fact that before him only 78
persons and one Asian had successfully completed such a voyage. During the 151 days voyage
which started from Mumbai on 01 November 2012, Abhilash was alone on the boat and neither
took any outside assistance nor used his engines for propulsion, he covered a distance of over
40,000 km. The entire voyage was completed using sails, regularly negotiating 10m waves and
over 100 kmph winds with the temperatures varying between 4 to 40 degree Celsius as he traversed
through different parts of the world. The lone sailor was often over 4000 to 5000 km away from
the nearest land and beyond the range of any meaningful rescue operation in the event of an
emergency, with only himself to rely on. During this entire voyage, many times turbulent weather
unfurled the boat’s largest sail, making the boat heel to the point of capsizing. On many occasions
Abhilash had to climb the mast to remove torn pieces of main sail and saved boat from getting
dismasted. The daunting 151 days voyage undertaken by the officer has no parallel in the Indian
maritime history.

CDI-87600,Petty Officer (then Leading Seamen),Chiman Singh,Indian Navy,"Petty Officer Chiman Singh was born on June 1, 1945, in Gokal Garh village located in the
Gurgaon district of what was then undivided Punjab. He had a deep passion for swimming and
diving in the local pond. Completing his matriculation from BS Ahir High School in Rewari,
Petty Officer Chiman Singh embarked on an extraordinary journey when he joined the Navy
as a sailor on June 12, 1961, at the remarkably young age of 16.
In late March in 1971, Petty officer Chiman Singh was an instructor in the Kochi diving school,
when the news of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declaring independence was broadcasted. The 1971
war was the third war between India and Pakistan, and the Indian Navy played an important
role in securing Indian victory in the war. During the initial days of the war, the Eastern
Command deployed a few ships on patrol across the sea lane to Chittagong and Khulna. In
May, Naval Headquarters started formulating the tasks to be assigned to the Western and
Eastern Naval Commands and deciding the allocation of forces. These tasks had to derive from
the capabilities and limitations of the ships, submarines and aircraft at that point in time.1
After undergoing refit for two years, in October 1971, the INAS 300, the premier Fighter
squadron of the Indian Navy embarked INS Vikrant with 15 pilots and 19 Sea Hawks, as the
Navy was suspecting an outbreak of hostilities in the Bay of Bengal. On receiving war orders,
Vikrant, with Kamorta, Brahmaputra and Beas in company, sailed out from Port Blair towards
East Pakistan on the night of 2/3 December. The Fleet made night passage through the Coco
Channel to avoid possible detection by other merchant ships. On 4 December 1971, Vikrant
launched 12 Sea Hawks, 140 miles from Cox’s Bazar.2
The relentless round-the-clock attacks by naval aircraft resulted in significant damage to
Pakistani military installations and harbours. Cox's Bazar airfield was among the targets that
sustained damage, and a total of fourteen Pakistani ships/coasters and six gunboats were
destroyed. Notably, the Pakistani submarine Ghazi was also sunk off the coast of

on Karachi between the nights of December 04 and 8, causing panic among the enemy and
inflicting massive damage to the Karachi harbour. However, the Indian Navy suffered a loss
during the operations in the Arabian Sea when the anti-submarine frigate Khukri was sunk. The
captain of the ship, Captain MN Mulla, displayed utmost courage and loyalty to the navy by
refusing to be evacuated and going down with the vessel. He was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra
posthumously.
Initially, many young Bengalis, in a bid to become ‘freedom fighters’, were eager to be trained
in guerrilla warfare. Chief of Naval Staff Admiral S M Nanda and Captain Mihir Roy (later
Vice Admiral and Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief East), Director Naval Intelligence,
swiftly orchestrated the training of these freedom fighters to turn them into naval commandos.
The site selected was a location in Plassey on the banks of the Bhagirathi. Seven Bengali
submariners from a Pakistani submarine docked at Toulon, France, shocked upon hearing about
the atrocities of the Pakistan Army, flew to Delhi and were inducted into the group of Mukti
Bahinis being trained—Roy and Samant enrolled them as team leaders for the operation. The
training team also included Commander V K Kapil and leading Seaman Chiman Singh. 3
The Indian Navy trained more than 400 young men. The trainees trained by the team of Petty
officer Chiman Singh were dispatched all over East Pakistan –Narayanganj, Mangla, Chalna,
Chittagong, and Cox's Bazar etc. Chiman Singh personally went to Barishal for an operation
in October. 4
A plan was carved out to attack Narayanganj, Mangla, Khulna ports on the night of 14/15
August 1971, the young men did a very good job and the attack was successful. In the next
attack, Chiman Singh was himself involved. Chiman Singh was part of the inaugural batch of
clearance divers, a newly introduced cadre in the Indian Navy in 1965. Clearance Divers play
a major role in clearing out mines from warships, installations, mechantmen etc.5

enemy targets in Mangla and Khulna area during 08-10 December operation. Among others
Chiman Singh boarded the ship Padma — it was a gunboat turned into a mine laying ship —
and sailed through Sundarbans en route to target enemy installations in the Mangla and Khulna
bays in East Pakistan. Their plan was to bombard Khulna and use limpet mines to destroy
barges and whatever targets were available.6 The three boats departed for Chalna, Mangla and
Khulna. However, their vessel came under enemy air attack while operating near Khulna and
since the boat was carrying a load of mines; there was a real danger of these mines detonating,
putting everyone onboard at risk. Consequently, they left the ship.
Petty Officer Chiman Singh was very badly wounded by the shrapnel. Meantime, enemy shore
defences started firing at the survivors in the water. Petty Officer Singh found that two
survivors were finding it difficult to keep afloat. Unmindful of his injuries and personal safety,
he went to their rescue and escorted them to the shore through heavy enemy fire. Once on the
shore, he rushed at the enemy exposing himself to the enemy fire, thereby making it possible
for his two colleagues to escape from being captured by the enemy. He was overpowered by
the Pakistani Army and was taken prisoner of war. He remained PoW for nearly eight days and
was later released upon the liberation of Bangladesh. Chiman Singh's heroic actions serve as
an inspiration to all and reflect the indomitable spirit of the Indian Navy. For his action he was
awarded the Maha Vir Chakra. As an honour to his brave deeds the Naval Deep Sea Diving
School named a Block after him.
Chiman Singh's actions during this mission exemplified the core values of the Navy, including
duty, honour, and courage. His unwavering determination to succeed against overwhelming
odds and his willingness to put his life on the line behind enemy lines demonstrated the highest
ideals of the diving cadre. Chiman Singh's heroic actions serve as an inspiration to all and
reflect the indomitable spirit of the Indian Navy.
The Indian Navy successfully achieved its primary objective of establishing effective
supremacy over the Arabian Sea. Throughout the duration of the war, the Pakistan Navy

Following the heroic actions of Leading Seaman Chiman Singh during Operation 'Cactus Lily',
he was duly recognized and honoured for his exceptional service. He was promoted to the rank
of Petty Officer. This promotion is a testament to his skills, dedication, and bravery within the
Indian Navy. Furthermore, in 2013, Chiman Singh was awarded the Friends of Liberation War
Honour by the President of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. This prestigious honour
acknowledges his significant contribution and support during the Bangladesh Liberation War,
highlighting his commitment to the cause of freedom and his invaluable role in the conflict. A

Limited and Ministry of Defence, Government of India.Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after its
establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant diplomatic
status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand for state recognition
of the PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into negotiations
with China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement in 1954. Within a
few weeks of Chou Enlai’s visit to India in 1954, the Chinese launched a protest against the
presence of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometers South of a border pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar
Pradesh. This was the first time, the Government of China laid claim to any part of Indian territory
formally. The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957, marked a turning point in Sino-
India relations as the Chinese occupied a large part of the Aksai Chin. This opened an opportunity
for China to come out with territorial claims against India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers
moved in further into Ladakh and established themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal,
just south of Dambu Guru. On 08 September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola
Post in the Eastern sector and began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in the
Eastern sector of Namka Chu sector as well as in the Western sector in Ladakh. An overwhelming
number of Chinese troops attacked the Indian soldiers but they fought the enemy with grit and
determination. The Chinese announced the cease-fire at midnight on 21/22 November 1962. 2

2 History of the Conflict with China, 1962. P.B Sinha. Col A.A. Athale (1992). History Division, Ministry of Defence,
Government of India.The role of the Indian Air Force in the conflict is significant in more ways than one. On the one
hand, the paucity of road communications on the Indian side of the border was such that the
deployment, maintenance and even the survival of ground forces were dependent on the air supply.
In the initial years, from 1959 to 1962, the Sino-India dispute was primarily focused on the Ladakh
sector. The Eastern sector in the McMahon was manned by Assam Rifles till 1961. The supply to
these isolated posts was carried out by Kalinga Airlines. As the ‘Forward Policy’ came into
operation in 1960, the Indian Army and Indian Air Force were directed to find suitable posts to
carry out an assessment of aerial supply in order to establish new posts. The Indian Air Force was
directed not to fly recce or fighter sorties within a 24 km belt from the border. This was not
applicable to transport aircraft which could fly right up to the border but were asked to not cross
the border on any account. In December 1961, as the Army was establishing additional posts, there
was an urgent request to waive this condition. 106 SQUADRON equipped with Canberra aircraft
and fitted with cameras carried out these tasks. Initially, the mission was for mapping purposes.
As the active operations started, these became recce missions, to find out the deployment and
strength of the Chinese. Most of these missions were in Aksai Chin, Tawang, Sela and Walong
areas. During the period 13 October to 11 November 1962, the Canberras flew 22 photo recce
missions, flying nearly 50 hours. Apart from these missions, there were no strategic missions
carried out that were controlled at the highest level.3
As the ‘Forward Policy’ came into operation in 1960, the Indian Army and Indian Air Force were

posts. No 106 Squadron equipped with Canberra aircraft and fitted with cameras carried out these

missions, flying nearly fifty hours. Apart from these missions, there were strategic missions carried
out that were controlled at the highest level.
No 106 Squadron (Lynx) of IAF was a newly raised squadron in 1957 in Bareilly but was moved
to Agra, and its role was to provide military aerial photography and aid in other operations. Wing
Commander Jag Mohan Nath affectionately known as Jaggi flew his twin-engine English Electric
Canberra PR.57 high-altitude long-range reconnaissance aircraft for this tough mission. The
aircraft was fitted with one camera for surveillance and four cameras for pictures. While flying
over Tibet, Xinjiang, he saw many Chinese soldiers positioned and the pictures clicked by his
3 Ibidcamera were sent directly to the HQ in Delhi. In fact, Wing Commander Jag Mohan Nath was first
to photograph the Aksai-Chin Highway in 1959.
During 1962 Sino-India War Wing Commander (Then Squadron Leader) Jag Mohan
Nath performed a number of risky operational missions while serving as the Flight Commander
of an operational squadron, including flying over challenging mountain terrain both during the day
and at night, inclement weather, and with utter disregard for his own safety. He showed notable
bravery, a strong sense of duty, and a high level of professional ability.4 For his gallantry he was
awarded Maha Vir Chakra.
However, within three years India found itself in another border conflict with Pakistan. Learning
from the mistakes of 1962 Sino-India war, Indian airpower grew exponentially giving India its
first kill in air-to-air combat since independence on 04 September 1965. The genesis of Indo-Pak
conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention between India and Pakistan
are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means.
The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our frontiers with Pakistan have remained a sensitive
zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at several points
of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of Pakistan have
been met by the Indian Armed Forces with commendable bravery and steely resilience, but always
with great restrain to not escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak war of 1965 was the second war fought
between these two bordering countries. While India was still recovering from the damages of Sino-
India war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might,
presuming India to be weak in terms of defence preparation. The war initiated on 24 April 1965,
when Pakistan Army, attacked our territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles
inside the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of
Indo-Pak Border Agreement 1960 and international law as per the United Nations Charter. The
aerial phase of the war began on 01 September 1965 when the Indian Air Force responded to an
urgent call for air strikes against the Pakistani Army.
In 1965, Indian Air Force comprised of twenty-six Fighter Squadrons, four Bomber Squadrons,
thirteen Transport Squadron and five Helicopter Units. During the 1965 Indo-Pak War, after the
failure of Operation Gibraltar, a desperate Pakistan Army mounted a major armour-cum-infantry
thrust in Chhamb, on 01 September 1965. The objective was to capture Akhnur Bridge and cut off
Jammu-Punch Road. The same day at 1600 Hr General Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri the Chief of Army
Staff and Air Marshal Arjan Singh, the Chief of Air Staff, met the Defence Minister Yashwantrao

High School Gujranwala prior to family migrating to India. He later settled in Hansi in Hissar,
Punjab. After a distinguished flying career spanning more than three decades, Wing Commander
Prem Pal Singh retired from the Indian Air Force as an Air Marshal on 28 Feb 1987.
The genesis of the Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu
and Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our frontiers with
Pakistan has remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off resorted to firing,
incursions and intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India to adopt defensive
measures. These attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed Forces with
commendable bravery and steely resilience, but always with great restrain to not escalate the
conflict. The Indo-Pak war of 1965 was the second war fought between these two bordering
countries. While India was still recovering from the damages of Sino-India war of 1962, Pakistan
saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might, presuming India to be weak
in terms of defence preparation. The war began on 24 April 1965, when the Pakistan Army attacked
our territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside the Indian territory. This
act of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of Indo-Pak
Border Agreement 1960 and international law as per the United Nations Charter. The aerial
phase of the war began on 01 September 1965 when the Indian Air Force responded to an urgent
call for air strikes against the Pakistani Army.
In 1965, Indian Air Force comprised of twenty-six Fighter Squadrons, four Bomber Squadrons,
thirteen Transport Squadron and five Helicopter Units. During the 1965 Indo-Pak War, after the
failure of Operation Gibraltar, a desperate Pakistan Army mounted a major armour-cum-infantry
thrust in Chhamb, on 01 September 1965. The objective was to capture Akhnur Bridge and cut
off Jammu-Punch Road. The same day at 1600 hours General Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri the Chief
of Army Staff and Air Marshal Arjan Singh, the Chief of Air Staff, met the Defence Minister
Yashwantrao Balwantrao Chavan and Defence Secretary Shri PVR Rao and sought permission to
use the Indian Air force (IAF) against the invaders. A go ahead was obtained and within an hour
the IAF went into action to stem the onslaught. 26 fighter-bombers of IAF (12 Vampires and 14
Mysteres) took off from Pathankot for Chhamb Sector just before sunset. In a swift action, the
IAF destroyed ten tanks, two automatic guns and 30-40 vehicles of the invading column. The
PAF Sabres, which were patrolling just across the border retaliated and shot down four Indian
Vampires killing three of our pilots.
Indian Army’s Operation Riddle, which targeted Lahore and Kasur, on 06 September 1965,
startled the Pakistani forces. Seeing the dire situation, Pakistan Premiere Ayub Khan ordered the
Pakistani Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Nur Khan, to target and eliminate the IAFoffensive capability. The CAS rolled out PAF’s war plan No. 6, which called for pre-emptive
strikes against the frontline IAF bases in Pathankot, Halwara, Adampur, Jamnagar, as well as the
IAF radars at Amritsar, Ferozpur and Porbandar. 06 September was pronounced to be the striking
day. As decided, PAF launched these raids on the evening of 06 September. All raids, except for
Pathankot, failed.
The Indian Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Arjan Singh, decided to retaliate and strike PAF bases
on 07 September. The IAF bases at Agra, Halwara and Adampur were alerted and tasked to carry
out multiple strikes against the PAF bases, including Sargodha, Dab, Wagowal, on 07 September

Wing Commander Prem Pal Singh was commanding the No. 5 “Tuskers” Squadron, stationed at
Agra. The unit equipped with the Canberra bomber, was assigned the triple task of tactical
bombing, close support and armed patrolling. The squadron operated the interdictor version of the
Canberra bomber featuring 4 x 20 mm Hispano cannons and the capacity to carry 16 x 4.5"" flares
or 3 x 1000 lb. bombs internally, along with 2 x 1000 lb. bombs on external stations. On their first
mission, Wing Commander Prem Pal Singh led a formation of four Canberra aircraft, launching a
dawn attack armed with 8 x 1000 lb. bombs, with each aircraft spaced one minute apart.Their mission was to strike a Pakistani Army Corps HQ situated near the town of Gujarat,
positioned west of a road near the town. However, upon reaching the target area, the formation
discovered no trace of the Corps HQ or any troop presence, only vast open fields. Despite this
unexpected turn, the aircrew followed their briefing instructions and released their bombs in the
designated area as directed.
Following the initial dawn strike, six Canberra aircraft conducted a subsequent mission to the same
target later in the day, with the added support of Gnats for escort. Unfortunately, this mission also
proved futile, seemingly due to faulty intelligence or an inaccurate appreciation of the Corps HQ's
location.
The Indian Air Force had executed all tasks assigned by the Army's Western Command. On
September 6, they conducted 31 Mystere sorties from Pathankot and Adampur, 16 Hunter sorties
from Halwara, and ten Canberra sorties from Agra, all in support of the Army's operations and
offensive reconnaissance in the XI Corps area. Additionally, 14 Gnat and four MiG-2 air defence
missions involving escorts and offensive sweeps were carried out in areas where ground attack
aircraft were supporting the Army. The Air Force reported significant destruction, claiming the
destruction of nine tanks, 12 heavy guns, four anti-aircraft guns, 26 vehicles, and one military
train. Remarkably, there was minimal interference during these activities, possibly attributed to
the presence of air defence aircraft in the region or Pakistan Air Force's preparations for their
planned preemptive strike that evening.
It is different that in some of the locations, the enemy Headquarters were not there and the pilots
had to look for alternate targets where they could usefully expend their armament.
Sargodha base was a prime target for the Indian Air Force, one of the most heavily defended
locations in Asia. On the night of 06 September 5 Squadron initiated their attack, with the first
bomb dropping late at night. Employing shallow dive attacks from medium altitudes, the Canberras
of 5 Squadron launched a nighttime raid on the airfield. Regrettably, the raid did not result in
significant damage.
In the initial strike conducted by the Mysteres of No. 1 Squadron, seven out of the eleven aircraft
managed to approach the target undetected, while the remaining four encountered navigational
challenges and fell behind. Despite poor visibility that prevented the aircraft above the target from
seeing the ground, the formation's leader, while pulling out of the dive, spotted a group of aircraft
positioned on the Operational Readiness Platform (ORP). Acting swiftly, the aircraft attacked
despite the limited visibility, and their efforts resulted in significant damage inflicted upon both
the BPI (Base Production Installation) and the aircraft parked at the ORP and within the hangars.One Mystere, piloted by Sqn Ldr AB Devayya, was reported missing. It was later learnt from a
Pakistani source that having accomplished a successful raid over Sargodha airfield, the said
Mystere was intercepted and damaged by a supersonic F-104 Star-fighter, piloted by Flt Lt Amjad
Hussain of PAF. With utter disregard for his personal safety, Sqn Ldr Devayya, manoeuvred his
damaged aircraft, and shot down the Star Fighter, from which Flt Lt Hussain ejected successfully.
For this exceptional act of gallantry Squadron Leader Devayya was awarded the Mahavir Chakra
in 1988, posthumously.
Under the skilled leadership of Wing Commander Prem Pal Singh, the Squadron executed tactical
bombing missions aimed at crippling the Pakistan Air Force on the ground. Wing Commander
Prem Pal Singh personally led these missions, resulting in successful attacks on various targets.
These included the Pakistani army camp located East of Gujarat, as well as airfields at Chaklala,
Dab, Murid, Akwal, Risalwala, Wagowal, Sargodha, and Peshawar.
The Squadron also provided close support to the Army in Kasur, Khem Karan, Pasrur, Chawinda
and Sialkot sectors. Bombs were dropped on the enemy concentrations at all these places. During
the period of war the Squadron undertook 39 sorties of armed patrolling over Agra, Palam,
Ambala, Halwara and Adampur. Most of the operational missions over the enemy territory were
carried out during the hours of darkness. The targets were identified in the moon-light. These
dangerous operational sorties were undertaken in the face of heavy enemy anti-aircraft fire with
exceptional courage and determination. For displaying high sense of duty and courage, he was
honoured with MahaVirChakra.
The Squadron also played a crucial role in providing close support to the Indian Army in various
sectors, including Kasur, Khem Karan, Pasrur, Chawinda, and Sialkot. They conducted bombing
runs on enemy concentrations in these areas, effectively aiding the ground forces. Throughout the
war, the squadron carried out 39 armed patrolling sorties over Agra, Palam, Ambala, Halwara, and
Adampur. Most of these operational missions took place under the cover of darkness, with targets
identified by moonlight. Undertaking these perilous sorties in the face of intense enemy anti-
aircraft fire demonstrated exceptional courage and unwavering determination. In recognition of
his outstanding sense of duty and bravery, Wing Commander Prem Pal Singh was honoured with
the #MahaVirChakra.
Air Marshal Prem Pal Singh later served in various capacities in the Air Force. He served as
Director of Air Force Intelligence, Air Officer Commanding No. 4 Wing (Agra) and Assistant
Chief of Air Staff (FS&I) at Air Headquarters New Delhi. Promoted to the Rank of Air Marshal –
he was posted as Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) incharge of operations at Eastern Air Command
(Shillong).In 1971, Air Marshal Prem Pal Singh, Group Captain at that time, served as the Staff Officer in
charge of operations at Command Headquarters. He played a pivotal role in meticulously
planning bomber operations in the western sector and against Pakistani occupation forces in
Bangladesh, significantly contributing to their success. Recognizing his outstanding leadership,
dedication, and service during both peacetime and wartime, he was honoured with the Ati
Vishisht Seva Medal. He also had the privilege of serving as ADC to the first President of India,
Dr Rajendra Prasad.
In 1982, For the conduct of IX Asian Games, he was appointed the Chief Administrator of the
Prestigious JawaharLal Nehru Stadium. This task involved dexterous handling and coordination
between multifarious agendas and was executed in a commendable manner. Later in 1985, Air
Marshal Prem Pal Singh was awarded the Param Vishisht Seva Medal for distinguished service of
the most exceptional order, while he was serving in the Air Headquarters as Vice Chief of Air
Staff (VCAS). Subsequently, in 1986, Air Marshal Singh was appointed as the Air Officer
Commanding in Chief of the South Western Air Command, a position he held until his retirement
in February 1987. His illustrious career and unwavering commitment to duty left an indelible mark
on the Indian Air Force.
Air Marshal Prem Pal Singh passed away on 13 August 2020, at the age of 91, at the Command
Hospital, Western Command, Chandimandir.","WING COMMANDER PREM PAL SINGH (3871) GD(P)

Aa a Flight Lieutenant in No.5 Squadron, Wing Commander Padmanabha Gautam was in the first
batch of Indian Expeditionary Forces deputed to Congo in 1961. Flight Lieutenant Gautam was
one of the pilots operating with the Canberra Unit in the Congo during 1961. On 6th of December,
1961, he was ordered to attack Kolwezi airfield in Katanga. Despite extreme adverse weather
conditions and heavy enemy opposition, he courageously and successfully carried out several
attacks on the airfield and completely destroyed Fauga aircraft which was harassing UN ground
forces. He also shot up tires on Katangese aircraft on the ground and neutralised other installations
around it. Flight Lieutenant Gautam also carried out several other successful missions or
Elizabethville in close support of the ground forces operating against Katangese.
Throughout the operations, Flight Lieutenant Gautam displayed commendable courage and
devotion to duty in the face of enemy. For his courage, devotion to duty and exemplary
performance, he was awarded the Vayu Sena Medal.
On his return, after very commendable operations with the UN forces in Congo, then Squadron
Leader Gautam was posted as the Commanding Officer of the Jet Bomber Conversion Unit to
pass on his unique skill of flying the Canberra bomber to other aspiring bomber pilots. During
this tenure, he was called upon to participate in the Indo-Pak war of 1965. In this war, titled
'Operation Riddle’.
The genesis of Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of contention
between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state of Jammu andKashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our frontiers with Pakistan

killing three of our pilots. 2
During 1965 Indo-Pak War, he led raids on Peshawar as lead aircraft, marking the target with
Target Indicating bombs and incendiary flares. In these missions, it was invariably the pathfinders
that indicated the targets. Success or failure depended a great deal on the accuracy of the
pathfinder. Their job was invariably unenviable. Heading much in front of other bombers, these
Canberras were specialists. They marked out the way to the target and the target as well. Six
aircraft flew all the way to the Afghan border to bomb the Peshawar airfield and successfully

Defence, Government of Indiaattacked the target. All the six aircraft returned without loss, in spite of interception by Pakistani
Starfighters carrying missiles.
Till the morning of 06 September IAF and PAF (Pakistani Air Force) were engaged in a limited
war. But the day marked beginning of a new phase in the air war when the Indian Army opened a
new front against Pakistan and the Pakistani President General Ayub Khan formally declared war
on India. On 06 September alone, IAF flew 31 Mystere sorties from Pathankot and Adampur, 16
Hunter sorties from Halwara and six Canberra sorties from Agra in support of the Indian Army
operations in the Chhamb Sector and for offensive recce in XI Corps area. 14 Gnat and four MiG-
21 air defence missions of ‘escort and sweep’ were undertaken in areas where ground attack
aircrafts were operative. The IAF claimed nine tanks, twelve heavy guns, four ack-ack guns,
twenty-six vehicles and one military train as destroyed.3
Throughout the war he was given a number of challenging and dangerous missions within
the enemy territory on short notice when combat first started. Between September 06 and 21
September 1965, he conducted six offensive, tactical, and close support missions deep into enemy
territory, despite intense ground fire and Pak Sabre jet attacks. These missions included
reconnaissance into enemy territory, destroying the airfields at Akwal and Gujarat, and strafing
enemy concentration in the Gujarat and Chawinda regions. He was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra
for exhibiting extraordinary bravery, determination, and devotion to duty.
In 1968, on completion of his tenure as the Commanding Officer of the Bomber Conversion
Training unit, Gautam was posted to Iraq, as part of the Indian Training Team. In this tenure, he
trained Iraqi pilots to fly the MiG-15, and MiG-17. An emergency during a training flight caused
a forced landing on the runway. True to form, Gautam displayed exemplary skill and presence of
mind saving two precious lives as well as an expensive aircraft of the Iraqi Air Force. He was
commended by the Iraqi Air Force for this act.
After his return from Iraq in 1969, he took over No.16 Squadron - The Cobras, based at Gorakhpur,
operating his favorite Canberra Bomber. In December 1971, the Squadron was deployed to
undertake bombing missions under ""Operation Cactus Lilly"" Wing Commander Gautam led six
missions under Operation Cactus Lilly,' from 3rd December to 15th December 1971, carrying out
three missions over West Pakistan and three missions over East Pakistan. For all six missions, the
navigator of his aircraft was Squadron Leader K.K.Dutta (KKD).
3 The Indian-Pakistan War of 1965: A History. S.N. Prasad. U.P. Thapliyal (2011). Natraj Publishers and Ministry of
Defence, Government of IndiaIndia gained Independence in 1947, following the partition of the country and the creation of
Pakistan. The foundation of Pakistan was laid by the Muslim League based on the two-nation
theory. Pakistan comprised two wings- East and West Pakistan which were geographically
separated by 1600 kms Indian territory. The two wings of Pakistan were culturally and
linguistically different and the diversities between the two wings could not be bridged by an
emotional appeal to religion. Consequently, fissures started erupting in the political body of
Pakistan soon after the Independence and with each passing year it widened. In the absence of
appropriate defence arrangements, the people of East Pakistan felt isolated and abandoned. Finally,
the malfeasance of Pakistani leadership during Cyclone Bhola and the overwhelming support for
the Awami League in the 1970 elections, proved the proverbial last straw on the camel’s back.4
The Awami League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (of East Pakistan) secured an absolute
majority in the general elections held in December 1970. This entitled the League to form a
Government in Pakistan. However, Pakistan’s military rulers denied this democratic right to the
Awami League, in connivance with the PPP, led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. This arbitrary act of
government caused deep resentment among the population of East Pakistan resulting in
widespread protests. When the slide became unmanageable, the Pakistani rulers resorted to a
midnight crackdown on 25 March 1971. Government ordered a military crackdown and repression
wherein, the Pakistan army under Lieutenant General Tikka Khan unleashed a reign of terror and
massacred thousands of Bengalis in a genocide code-named ‘Operation Searchlight’. Pakistan
launched its attack against India on 03 December 1971. The Indo-Pak War of 1971 was the first
war when the Indian Government engaged all three services on a large scale.
As the tension mounted along the Indo-Pak borders, violations of the Indian Air Space by PAF
became very frequent. In November 1971, ten major air violations had taken place in areas around
Srinagar, Amritsar, Jammu, Jamnagar and Ganganagar. In the Eastern sector, on 22 November
1971, three PAF F-86 Sabres were shot over Boyra. On 03 December at 1745Hr, the PAF
simultaneously attacked Indian airfields at Amritsar, Srinagar, Avantipur and Pathankot, the
Advance Landing Ground (ALG) at Faridkot and the radar unit at Amritsar. complete
understanding between the Army and the IAF also effectively halted Pakistan’s determined
offensive during the Battle of Longewala. In the Eastern sector, the IAF achieved total air
superiority within the first 24 hours of the outbreak of hostilities. The first heli-borne operation
was undertaken by the IAF in 1971 when it heli-lifted 4/5 GORKHA RIFLES and landed them at
Sylhet nearly 100 kilometres behind enemy lines. IAF also helped in air bridging the innumerable
water obstacles crisscrossing the countryside. The effective coordination and cooperation among
the tri-services sealed the Indian victory in this war.
4 The India-Pakistan War of 1971: A History. S.N Prasad and U.P. Thapliyal. (2014). Natraj Publishers and Ministry of
Defence, IndiaWing Commander Gautam's first mission was on 03-04 December 1971 morning over Mianwali.
He and Dutta took off from Gorakhpur and landed at Ambala, where the aircraft was to be loaded
with special bombs. Though it was planned to attack the runway at the airfield with special bombs,
since the 'Y' plan bombs could not be made ready, the aircraft was loaded with conventional 8 X
1000 bombs to be dropped from 7000 feet. They returned to Gorakhpur after refueling at Ambala
after a successful completion of the mission.
The second mission on the western sector by him and Squadron. Leader Dutta was also to
Mianwali on 04-05 December 1971. Unlike the previous night, the special bombs under 'Y' plan
were prepared and loaded in time for the mission. They undertook the mission and found
themselves facing heavy fire from anti-aircraft guns (ack-ack). They dived to 100 to 200 feet to
fly parallel over the runway and release this special bomb. The only light visible was the ack-ack
tracers which illuminated the runway. They had to fly under the arcs of the ack-ack along the
runway.The heavy fire did not deter Wing Commander Gautam and Squadron Leader Dutta in
adhering to the plan and release the special bombs which spread the jelly and the spikes over the
runway at this important air field, affecting PAF operations the next day.
While they were flying low over the runway, the ack-acks were firing just above the; aircraft,
almost at the same height as the aircraft. It was providence that the guns faledio score a hit on
Gautam's aircraft. During the post-flight debriefing, Wing Commander Gautan expressed that the
risk level in such sorties was of extreme nature, as experienced by him and Dutta in the final stage
of the raid.
Nevertheless, in the annals of the Indian Air Force, Wing Commander Gautam and Squadron
Leader Dutta's mission on the 04 December 1971 over Mianwali, operating at 100 feet, being
exposed to tremendous risk, stands as an exceptional act of bravery and highly skillful flying and
navigation at low level.
Wing Commander Gautam's third mission over West Pakistan was an interdiction mission over
Raiwind rail marshalling yard about 15 NM south of Lahore. They did the first run over the yard
with rockets and three subsequent runs with 20 mm front guns. Heavy ack-ack was experienced
during these runs, but they came back unscathed. The subsequent three missions were flown over
East Pakistan. Out of these, the first being on 11 December, was a daytime attack as a single aircraft
over an army concentration near the west bank of river Sitalakha, East of Dhaka.
The fifth mission of Gautam and Dutta was also over East Pakistan on the 13th of December. It
was a bombing mission over Tezgaon, Dhaka's well-defended military-cum-civil air base. This
mission was carried out as Hi-Lo-Hi mission from Gorakhpur. The sixth mission flown by this
crew was the last mission of the war, flown on 15th December to bomb Kurmitola Airfield at
Dhaka. Though they were to bomb the airfield from 7000 feet, because of the cloud cover up to4900 feet, they descended below the cloud and released the bombs over the airfield at 1630 hrs. In
this three aircraft raid, the last aircraft flown by Fight Lieutenant Brian Wilson and Flight
Lieutenant R B Mehta was lost to ground force over Dacca. Wing Commander Padmanabha
Gautam was awarded a Bar to Maha Vir Chakra for gallantry during the 1971 Bangladesh
Liberation Operations.
On completing his tenure at No. 16 Squadron, in 1972, Wing Commander Padmanabha Gautam
was posted as Chief Operating Officer (COO) of No.4 Wing, Pune. During his curtailed tenure as
COO, No. 4 Wing, Gautam converted himself to fly the famous MiG-21, which had given a
creditable performance in the 1971 operations. On the morning of 25 November 1972, while taking
off from runway 27 at Pune, the engine of his MiG-21 FL aircraft failed. Since this version of MiG
had an ejection seat which could operate only above a height of 300 meters, he had no possibility
of ejection. His aircraft crashed into rocks and burst into flames engulfing the greatest hero of the
IAF, leading to his very untimely demise. Most of the stalwarts of the Canberra operations
assembled at Pune to bid farewell to Wing Commander Padmanabha Gautam, a personification of
all the qualities of a very able leader, pilot, and exemplary human in all respects.","SQUDRON LEADER PADMANABHA GAUTAM, VM (4482) F(P)

restructured, and most Rajput Regiments became Battalions of the 7th Rajput Regiment.
These included the 2nd Queen Victoria’s Own, 4th Prince Albert Victor’s, 7th (Duke of
Connaught’s Own), and 11th Rajputs. Before India gained independence from the British
Empire, the Regiment consisted of Rajputs and Punjabi Muslims. The Regimental insignia is
a pair of crossed Rajputi Katars flanked by three Ashoka leaves on either side. This is
mounted by the Lion Capital of Ashoka and a scroll below with the words “The Rajput
Regiment” The Regimental motto of Rajput Regiment is ‘Sarvatra Vijaya’ meaning ‘Victory
everywhere’. In Operation VIJAY 1999, 27 RAJUPT displayed exemplary valour in the battle
fought at Point 5770. Field Marshal KM Cariappa, the first Indian Army Chief and General
VK Singh, PVSM, AVSM, YSM who was also the Army Chief both belong to the Rajput
Regiment and have been the Colonel of the Regiment.
The genesis of the Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of
contention between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile
state of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our
frontiers with Pakistan have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off
resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling
India to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian
Armed Forces with commendable bravery and steely resilience, but always with great
restraint to not escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak war of 1965 was the second war fought
between these two bordering countries. While India was still recovering from the Sino-India
war of 1962, Pakistan saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might,
presuming India to be weak in terms of defence preparation. The war began on 24 April 1965,
when the Pakistan Army attacked Indian territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to
eight miles inside the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian territory
constituted violation of the Indo-Pak Border Agreement, 1960 and the international law as per
the United Nations Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the
launch of Operation Gibraltar.
In view of the alarming increase in cease-fire violations by Pakistan, the Indian Army chose
not to remain passive any longer. It decided to inflict maximum casualties on the encroachers
in the event of any violation.
There were Pakistani Posts on the heights in Kargil area, commanding the vital Srinagar-Leh
Road, which constituted the main supply route for the Indian troops in Ladakh. The Kargil
region falls between the Ladakh Range in the North-East and the Great Himalayan Range in
the South-West. The Pakistani defences at Point 13620 dominated the Indian positions,
including the Brigade Headquarters at Kargil. On 16 May 1965, the Pakistanis attacked one of
the Indian Posts in strength. The attack was repulsed, and 4 RAJPUT was ordered to push
back the intruders and capture the Point. This Point was a dominating feature and was
strongly held by the intruders. Captain Ranbir Singh was commanding the leading Platoon.
This Platoon advanced through extremely difficult terrain over cliffs and high hills and
attacked the feature at 0200 hours on 17 May 1965. During the advance, the Platoon came
under heavy mortar, light machine gun and small arms fire. Undaunted, Captain Ranbir Singh
moved forward and charged the objective. He destroyed a Post which was trying to hold upthe advance and then captured the first peak of the Point. In the encounter he was himself hit
by an enemy bullet which grazed his scalp.
The two Recce Patrols sent by 4 RAJPUT to Point 13620 and Black Rocks discovered that the
Pakistani troops (Company supported by MMGs and 3-Inch Mortars) were occupying Point
13620, Saddle, Black Rocks, Peak 1 and Peak 2, had encroached into Indian territory. Indian
121 (Independent) Infantry Brigade Group consisting of 4 RAJPUT, 1 JAK RIF and 17
PUNJAB) and 1 GUARDS (ex 3 Infantry Division) held this area in strength. Two
Companies of 12 JAK LI and 85 Light Regiment were also in support.
In view of the encroachments Brig VK Ghai, Commander 121 (Independent) Infantry Brigade
Group, decided to launch a two-pronged attack on Pakistani Posts with 4 RAJPUT,
commanded by Lt Col Sudarshan Singh and supported by 85 Light Regiment less a Battery.
He also decided to use the Southern approach for attack on Point 13620, as it was a difficult
and hazardous route, where the Pakistani defences were not likely to be strong. In fact,
Pakistani troops expected an attack through the central approach and therefore, had their
defences strengthened with mine strips on this route.
Two Companies of 4 RAJPUT were to capture Point 13620 and Saddle from the South and a
third Company was to capture Black Rocks Peak 1 and 2 from the North-East. Strict security
measures were adopted during the preparatory stage. Villages in the area were sealed and all
forward moves were made in the night. No civilian labour or ponies were employed. The
approach march had to be in single file as Forming Up Place was barely 90 meters from
enemy bunkers. As there was just sufficient room to deploy one Platoon, the attacking
Company had to deploy its Platoons one behind the other in echelons.

within 90 meters of Point 13620, undetected. But soon after the Company came under heavy
mortar, Light Machine Gun and small arms fire, and a hand-to-hand fight commenced. Major
BS Randhawa, the Company Commander was killed. Lieutenant Colonel Sudarshan Singh,
who was following him, immediately rallied the men to maintain the momentum of the attack.
On the North-East side, progress was a bit slow as surprise had been lost. The Forward
Observations Officer, Captain N Darkunde, accompanying Major Nayyar's Company, brought
down artillery fire on Saddle, Black Rocks, Peak 1 and Peak 2. Indian Medium Machine Guns
and 3-Inch mortars also opened up on the enemy positions. Point 13620 was captured by 0330
hours. Major Nayyar's Company also occupied Peak 1 and Peak 2 by 0430 hours. The Black
Rocks and Saddle fell by 1030 hours.
The opposition was stiff, but the fierce onslaught of the Indian troops forced the Pakistanis to
withdraw leaving behind their dead and a large quantity of arms, ammunition and rations.
They suffered 2 Officers and 14 ORs killed. On the Indian side 1 Officer, 2 JCOs and 9 ORs
were killed, and 1 JCO and 50 ORs were wounded.

He was born on 10 October 1942 to Shri Sher Singh. Sepoy Govardhan Singh enrolled in the
prestigious Dogra regiment of the Indian Army on 10 October 1959.
The Dogra Regiment, raised in 1877 is one of the older infantry regiments of the Indian Army.
The regiment traces its roots directly from the 17th Dogra Regiment of the British Indian Army.
After World War I, the British Indian government restructured the army, moving from regiments
with a single battalion to multi battalion regiments. In 1945, it shed the numeral ‘17’ and became
Dogra Regiment. The Dogra Regiment has troops from Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir
and the Northern districts of Punjab. Their regimental war cry is - “Jwala Mata Ki Jai” (Victory to
Goddess Jwala). The Dogras have participated in all the wars and conflicts fought by the Indian
Army since independence and winning laurels. 1 DOGRA also served as a part of the Indian
contingent at ONUC under 99 Infantry Brigade in 1961-63.
The United Nations Operation in the Congo was established on 14 July 1960 by the Security
Council Resolution 143 and dissolved on 30 June 1964. The initial mandate of ONUC was to
ensure the withdrawal of Belgian forces from the Republic of the Congo, assist the Government
in maintaining law and order and provide technical assistance. Subsequently, ONUC became
embroiled by the force of circumstances in a chaotic internal situation of extreme complexity and
had to be converted to use of military force. ONUC was to protect the Congo from outside
interference, particularly by evacuating foreign mercenaries and advisers from Katanga and
preventing clashes and civil strife, by force, if necessary, as a last resort. In 1961-62 secessionist
gendarmes under the command of foreign mercenaries clashed with the United Nations Force. At
its peak, the ONUC had 20,000 troops including a brigade from India. In February 1963, after
Katanga had been reintegrated into the national territory of the Congo, ONUC began to be phased
out.
During the UN peacekeeping mission in Congo, the Congolese rebels (gendarmerie) often
launched violent attacks against the UN forces and Congolese governing bodies. On 13 September
1961, during a UN deployment mission in Congo, a company of the 1 DOGRA was attacking an
enemy position at Radio Katanga in Congo. During the attack the company faced fire from Light
Machine Guns (LMG), automatic rifles and grenades from all directions. Sepoy Govardhan Singh
showing vigilance traced one of the LMG that was preventing his section from moving forward to
the objective. He assaulted the enemy position and turned the muzzle of the gun away from the
troops of his section. During the close combat with enemy, he killed the personnel of the
Gendarmerie LMG detachment. Sepoy Govardhan Singh was badly wounded in his face duringthe close combat with enemy forces yet he continued to fight till the men of the enemy detachment
were killed.
Sepoy Govardhan Singh was awarded Vir Chakra, for his quick thinking, outstanding bravery and
courage of a high order.","No. 3951284 Sepoy Goverdhan Singh, 1 Bn. The Dogra Regiment.
(Effective date of award - 13th September 1961)
On 13th September 1961 a Company of the Dogra Regiment, attacking an enemy position at Radio
Katanga, faced fire from light machine guns, automatic rifles and grenades from all directions.
Sepoy Goverdhan Singh located one of the light machine guns which were preventing one of our
Sections from moving forward towards the objective. He jumped on the enemy position and turned
the muzzle of the gun away from our troops and in a close combat killed the personnel of the
Gendarmerie light machine- gun detachment. In doing so he was badly wounded in the face but he
continued fighting till the men of the enemy detachment were killed.
Sepoy Goverdhan Singh destroyed a dangerous enemy position and saved the lives of many of his
comrades. In doing so he set an inspiring example of courage, determination and devotion to duty.

commanders for this UN Mission.
The highly regarded platoon of the 3 PARA (KUMAON) [Now 3 PARA (SF)] was engaged
in clearing the minefields. Havildar Dewan Singh, while obeying the command of his
commander, displayed commendable gallant and courage by accounting to several plastic
anti-tank and anti-personnel mines. Havildar Dewan Singh being no.1 leading man of the
1st mine lifting party, along with Naik Puran Chand while prodding for mines got exposed to
a massive mine explosion. An Anti-personnel plastic mine got activated and went off very
near to him and he got severely injured and received shrapnel wounds in many parts of his
body. Despite being severely wounded and with negligible visibility, due to dense clouds of
dust, his duty spurred him to continue to lead his party by personally going forward to assist
Naik Puran Chand to neutralize the 18th anti-tank mine of the day. The mine, however,
exploded blowing up both Havildar Dewan Singh and Naik Puran Chand.
Havildar Dewan Singh and his sacrifice have made him an integral part of the Indian Army’s
glorious history. This act made him an eternal source of inspiration for the generations to
come. For his undiminishing dedication and resilience, Havildar Dewan Singh received for
his duty Ashoka Chakra CL-III (now Shaurya Chakra).","No. 1138887 Havildar Dewan Singh, 3 Bn The Para Regt. (Kumaon) (Posthumous) (10th

Puran Chand and accounted for 17 plastic anti - tank mines and several anti-personnel mines.
Although suffering from fatigue he refused to fall back in the absence of experienced relief in
plastic mine lifting. While Naik Puran Chand and his party were prodding the mines, an anti-
personnel mine went off at a distance of five yards and severely wounded Havildar Dewan
Singh. In Spite of this, his sense of duty spurred him to continue to lead his party by
personally going forward to assist Naik Puran Chand neutralise the 18th anti-tank mine of the
day. The mine, however, exploded blowing up both Havildar Dewan Singh and Naik Puran
Chand.Havildar Dewan Singh set a fine example of leadership and personal courage. He sacrificed
his life in the performance of his duty. Throughout the operations none of his men were
involved in any accident and he was personally responsible for neutralising several anti-tank
mines which needed skilled engineering experience, Havildar Dewan Singh’s supreme
sacrifice in the cause of his duty has set a fine example in the best traditions of our army.

Lahual Spiti District of Himachal Pradesh. He was enrolled in 7 J&K MILITIA (later
LADAKH SCOUTS) of the Indian Army on 17 June 1948 at the age of seventeen. During the
Sino India War of 1962, Havildar Satingian Phunchok was deployed in the Chushul Sub-
Sector where he fought the Chinese in the battle of Changla Post and sacrificed himself for
the nation. He was awarded Maha Vir Chakra posthumously.
The LADAKH SCOUTS known as the “Snow Warriors” were initially raised as a Paramilitary
Force formed of the Ladakhi locals known as Nubra Guards to save Ladakh from intruders in
1948. It comprised of Ladakhi locals who are physically fit and attuned with the rugged terrain
and hostile climate. In 1952, the Nubra Guards were merged as the 7th Battalion of the Jammu
& Kashmir Militia, which later became the Jammu & Kashmir Light Infantry (JAK LI)
Regiment. The Ladakh Scouts was raised in 1963, following the Indo China War of 1962. It
was formed by spinning off the 7th and 14th Battalions of J&K MILITIA. LADAKH SCOUTS
had two Wings- the Karakoram Wing, defending the Eastern front facing China and the Indus
Wing facing Pakistan. They fought in the 1965 and 1971 India Pakistan War and were also part
of Operation Meghdoot in 1984. They also played a significant role by achieving one of the
earliest victories during the Kargil War of 1999 and also received the Unit","from
General VP Malik, the then Chief of Army Staff.1 The Ladakh Scouts was converted into a
Regiment in the year 2000 and currently consists of five battalions.
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after
its establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant
diplomatic status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state
recognition of PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into
negotiations with China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement
in 1954. Within a few weeks of Chou Enlai’s visit to India in 1954, the Chinese launched a
protest against the presence of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometers south of a border
pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the first time, the Government of China laid claim
to any part of Indian territory formally. The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957
marked a turning point in the Sino-India relations as the Chinese occupied a large part of the
Aksai Chin. This opened an opportunity for China to come out with territorial claims against
India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved in further into Ladakh and established
themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal, just South of Dambu Guru. On 08
September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Post in the Eastern Sector and
began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in the Eastern Sector in Namka Chu

(2013)Sector as well as in the Western Sector in Ladakh. The overwhelming number of the Chinese
troops attacked the Indian soldiers but they fought the enemy with grit and determination. The
Chinese announced the cease-fire at midnight of 21/22 November 1962.2

Pradesh, India.
The fighting in Ladakh during the 1962 War was in three distinct phases. The first Phase began
on 19 October night when Chinese commenced their attacks against the isolated 'Forward
2 History of the Conflict with China, 1962. P.B Sinha. Col A.A. Athale (1992). History Division, Ministry of Defence,
Government of India.Policy’ Posts. This Phase lasted till 27 October. Between this time and 18 November there was
a ‘lull’ in fighting. This period was utilized by both sides to build up their strength, while the
Chinese build up was mainly opposite Spangur Gap, the Indian side strengthened defences in
depth. In the third and final phase the Chinese overwhelmed the Indian defences on the Eastern
edge of Chushul airfield. On declaration of Cease-Fire on 21 November 1962, the Chinese had
rendered the airfield unusable for use.
In this Sector, the peculiar geography of Ladakh made it doubly difficult for the soldiers as the
struggle was not just with the enemy but also with the high-altitude terrain. In September 1962,
Ladakh was defended by 114 Brigade consisting of 5 JAT, 1/8 GORKHA RIFLES, 7 and 14
JAMMU & KASHMIR MILITIA located at Leh. 14 J&K MILITIA with a Company of 5 JAT
was in Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) Sector. The remaining elements of 5 JAT were in
Changchenmo Sector, 1/8 GORKHA RIFLES was in Chushul with 7 J&K MILITIA at the
Indus Valley Sector. The Indus Valley Sector lies south of Chushul. Dungti was an important
location from where a road went North to Chusul, West to Leh and South along the Indus to
Demchok. The Indus River valley South of Dungati is a flat open area flanked by low hills on
the East. The international boundary followed the Eastern hills. These hills had several passes
opening to Tibetan Plateau. Vehicular movement along presented no problems and excellent
airfield existed at Fukche. The road communications on the Chinese side were not well
developed and the only approach was from the South. The Chinese were estimated to have had
a Battalion located in Tashigong.
On the Indian side 7 J&K MILITIA was responsible for the defence of this Sub-Sector with its
Headquarters at Koyul with one Company strength at Dungti and the rest of the troops being
deployed along the passes and bottlenecks along the international border. The Chinese attacks
in this Sector started on 27 October. They attacked simultaneously at Changla, Jarala, New
Demchok and High Ground (North West of Demchok). The Chinese plan of attack followed
the pattern established elsewhere. They launched simultaneous attacks on Changla and Jarala
Posts that held the line of low hills on Eastern side of the Indus valley. Once having tackled
these Posts they then infiltrated between Fukche and the extreme Southern Posts of New
Demchok and High Ground, thus making these untenable. Once having occupied the Kailash
Range that dominated the Eastern bank of the Indus valley, they in effect denied its use by the
Indians.
Changla Post was well dug-in with wire obstacles around it. It was defended by seventeen men
of 7 J&K MILITIA. In the early hours of 27 October, the Chinese approached the vicinity of
the post in thirty odd vehicles. The vehicles were mounted with Machine Guns, which opened
fire on the Indian Post. The response from Indians was quick in coming using 2-inch Mortars
the two Chinese leading vehicles were set on fire. The men held their fire till the Chinese came
close and within their rifle range. The two Light Machine Guns (LMG) effectively engagedattacking Chinese. After nearly three hours of fire fight, the vastly outnumbered Post
Commander decided to withdraw his men.
Nearly 300 Chinese soldiers had surrounded the Post. The Post Commander divided his party
in two. and while one party moved, he himself gave covering fire with LMG. The threat to
Dungti and Koyul also needed to be averted and therefore the troops in conjunction with those
at High Ground were asked to carry out a withdrawal by night on 27/28 October. The
withdrawal was successfully completed by 2330 hours. The defenders successfully evaded the
Chinese roadblock under the cover of darkness and arrived in Koyul in good spirits. The newly
established 3 Himalayan Division as well as 15 Corps gave a serious thought to order
withdrawal from Koyul as well, but in the end left the decision to the Commander on the spot,
Lieutenant Colonel RM Banon. He preferred to stay put and strengthen the defences rather than
withdraw. The Indians continued to occupy these positions. There was some confusion
regarding outposts at Hanle and Zarser and Chumar lying to the South West of this Sector.
These posts were held by CRP/ITBP and went out of communication on 27 October. These
were also presumed to have fallen to the Chinese. But by 31 October it; transpired that all these
Posts were intact. At the end of the fighting on 28 October, the Chinese had established control
of the Eastern hills flanking the Indus valley. Havildar Satingian Phunchok came under heavy
shelling when Chinese started their attack with overwhelming number of soldiers on 27
October 1962. Havildar Phunchok showed unflinching courage and inflicted heavy casualties
on the enemy. He did not yield an inch until he was overpowered in his trench and killed. He
displayed courage and devotion to duty of a high order.

"9100678, JC-70464",Naib Subedar (Then Naik),Chhimat Dorje,SCOUTS),"Naib Subedar (then Naik) Chhimat Dorje was born on 28 February 1934 in Sabu Village of
Leh District, Jammu & Kashmir. His parent’s names were Sonam Angdus and Stanzin
Dolma. He enrolled in 7 J&K MILITIA (later LADAKH SCOUTS) of the Indian Army on
31 July 1954 at the age of twenty. During the Sino India War of 1962, Naik Chhimat Dorje
fought the Chinese in Ladakh Sector bravely and sacrificed himself for the nation. He was
awarded Vir Chakra posthumously. Naik Chhimat Dorje was married to Chhering Putit and
had two sons Chhewang Nurbu and Tsering Angchok.
The LADAKH SCOUTS known as the “Snow Warriors” were initially raised as a Paramilitary
Force formed of the Ladakhi locals known as Nubra Guards to save Ladakh from intruders in
1948. It comprised of Ladakhi locals who are physically fit and attuned with the rugged terrain
and hostile climate. In 1952, the Nubra Guards were merged as the 7th Battalion of the Jammu
& Kashmir Militia, which later became the Jammu & Kashmir Light Infantry (JAK LI)
Regiment. The Ladakh Scouts was raised in 1963, following the Indo China War of 1962. It
was formed by spinning off the 7th and 14th Battalions of J&K MILITIA. LADAKH SCOUTS
had two Wings- the Karakoram Wing, defending the Eastern front facing China and the Indus
Wing facing Pakistan. They fought in the 1965 and 1971 India Pakistan War and were also part
of Operation Meghdoot in 1984. They also played a significant role by achieving one of the
earliest victories during the Kargil War of 1999 and also received the Unit","from
General VP Malik, the then Chief of Army Staff.1 The Ladakh Scouts was converted into a
Regiment in the year 2000 and currently consists of five battalions.
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China. Therefore, soon after
its establishment on 01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant
diplomatic status to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state
recognition of PRC on various international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into
negotiations with China on the question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement
in 1954. Within a few weeks of Chou Enlai’s visit to India in 1954, the Chinese launched a
protest against the presence of Indian troops in Barahoti, three kilometers south of a border
pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the first time, the Government of China laid claim
to any part of Indian territory formally. The construction of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957
marked a turning point in the Sino-India relations as the Chinese occupied a large part of the
Aksai Chin. This opened an opportunity for China to come out with territorial claims against
India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved in further into Ladakh and established
themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal, just south of Dambu Guru. On 08
September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Post in the Eastern sector and
1

Sector as well as in the Western Sector in Ladakh. The overwhelming number of the Chinese
troops attacked the Indian soldiers but they fought the enemy with grit and determination. The
Chinese announced the cease-fire at midnight of 21/22 November 1962.2

Government of India.The fighting in Ladakh during the 1962 War was in three distinct phases. The first Phase began
on 19 October night when Chinese commenced their attacks against the isolated 'Forward
Policy’ Posts. This Phase lasted till 27 October. Between this time and 18 November there was
‘lull’ in fighting. This period was utilized by both sides to build up their strength, while the
Chinese build up was mainly opposite Spangur Gap, the Indian side strengthened defences in
depth. In the third and final phase the Chinese overwhelmed the Indian defences on the Eastern
edge of Chushul airfield. On declaration of Cease-Fire on 21 November 1962, the Chinese had
rendered the airfield unusable for use.
In this Sector, the peculiar geography of Ladakh made it doubly difficult for the soldiers as the
struggle was not just with the enemy but also with the high-altitude terrain. In September 1962,
Ladakh was defended by 114 Brigade consisting of 5 JAT, 1/8 GORKHA RIFLES, 7 and 14
JAMMU & KASHMIR MILITIA located at Leh. 14 J&K MILITIA with a Company of 5 JAT
was in Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) Sector. The remaining elements of 5 JAT were in

Most of the battalions of the Regiment participated in the Indo-Pak Wars of 1965 and 1971 and
accomplished their assigned tasks in a commendable manner. 10 BIHAR was awarded the Theatre
Honour of `AKHAURA' for its gallant action in the Battle of Akhaura in East Pakistan in 1971. 1
BIHAR participated in ‘OPERATION VIJAY’ in the Batalik Sub Sector and was responsible for
recapture of Jubar Hill and Tharu. For its valour, the unit was honoured with Chief of the Army Staff

1 BIHAR was the first Bihar Battalion to take part in United Nation peace keeping mission. The
battalion was deployed in Somalia in 1993-1994. Later 10 BIHAR, 5 BIHAR and 14 BIHAR have also
had the distinction of participating in United Nation peace keeping operations in Congo in 2004, 2009
and 2014 respectively.1
India China Border Crisis
India and China have longstanding border issue, and are yet to resolve their boundary problem. China
does not accept the customary and traditional alignment of the boundary between India and China.
India, on the other hand believe that this alignment is based on well-established geographical principles
confirmed by treaties and agreements, as well as historical usage and practice, well-known for
centuries to both sides. The Chinese position, however, is that the boundary between the two countries
has not been formally delimited, that there exists a traditional customary line formed by the extent of
jurisdiction that they claim was exercised historically by each side, and that the two sides have different
interpretations of the position of the traditional customary line. The two countries had engaged in
discussions during 1950s-60s but these efforts could not yield a mutually acceptable solution.2

China invaded Tibet and annexed it in March 1959. Growing concern over Chinese aggression forced
India to relook at its border policy, as China became India’s neighbour. India enacted the ""Forward
Policy"" in 1960, which was aimed to prevent Chinese incursions into Indian territory by establishing
Indian stations near the Sino-Indian boundary.3 In reaction to the Forward Policy, China started
gradually enhancing her road infrastructure leading to the border and strengthening her military
positions along the border. 4 The Chinese quickened the forward movement of their posts, and soon
the empty area between the two armies disappeared. When some Indian posts, for example in the
Galwan Valley were established, the Chinese attitude changed and became more threatening. Instead
of going back they encountered Indian posts, surrounding the post to cut off its land route of supply,
and even opened fire at a number of places.

On 30 April 1962, the Chinese government threatened to impose an extension of the patrolling along
the entire boundary. Chinese forces surrounded an Indian position in the Galwan Valley in July 1962.
The two sides clashed at Pangong Lake. They also continued to set up a number of new aggressive
military posts in the Ladakh region. China stepped up its aggressive military actions along the Indian
border in the early months of 1962. On 08 September 1962, Chinese forces breached the border in the
Northwest corner of NEFA. On October 20, 1962, they launched a massive attack on Indian territory
in both the Eastern and Western Sectors following a series of probing operations.5
The first India-China War broke out putting an end to any chance of resolving the conflict in line with
accepted international norms.
Following the 1965 war with Pakistan, China initiated disturbances along the Tibet-Sikkim border,
particularly at Nathu-la Pass. In 1967, India China clash took place due to disagreement over the laying
of the border fence at Nathu La by Indian Armed Forces from 11 to 14 September 1967. The skirmish
escalated to artillery guns and threats of fighter jets. Similarly, at Tulung La in 1975, an Assam Rifles
patrol was fired upon killing four soldiers of the 5 Assam Rifles Battalion.
India used to occupy a seasonal post at Wangdong near Sumdrong Chu from 1984. When they
withdrew from the post for the winter of 1985, it was populated by the Chinese forces. On 16 June
1986, a patrol of 12 ASSAM Regiment of the Indian Army noticed Chinese presence in the area and
construction of a few permanent structures. The Chinese soldiers were initially identified to be 40 and
were soon reinforced by 200 more troops. By August, they had constructed a helipad and were being
air supplied.6 After rounds of diplomatic parleys and talks between military commanders, the two sides
agreed to vacate two posts. 7

Summer 2023requires patience and have committed to seeking a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution
through dialogue and peaceful negotiations. In the interim, the two sides also agreed that maintenance
of peace and tranquility in the border areas is an essential basis for the further development of bilateral
relations.
China continues to be in illegal occupation of approximately 38,000 sq. kms in the Union Territory of
Ladakh. In addition, under the so-called Sino-Pakistan 'Boundary Agreement' of 1963, Pakistan
illegally ceded 5,180 sq. kms. of Indian territory in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir to China. China also
claims approximately 90,000 sq. kms. of Indian territory in the Eastern Sector of the India-China
boundary in Arunachal Pradesh.
There is no commonly delineated Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the border areas between India and
China and there is no common perception of the entire LAC. Therefore, in order to ensure peace and
tranquility in the border areas, especially along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the two countries
have concluded a number of agreements and protocols.
Under these agreements, the two sides have agreed to maintain peace and tranquility along the LAC
without any effect to their respective positions on the alignment of the LAC as well as on the boundary
question. It is on this basis, that overall relations also saw considerable progress since 1988. India’s
position is that while bilateral relations can continue to develop in parallel with discussions on
resolving the boundary question, any serious disturbance in peace and tranquility along the LAC in the
border areas is bound to have implications on the positive direction of ties.
A key element of both the 1993 and the 1996 Agreements is that the two sides will keep their military
forces in the areas along the Line of Actual Control to a minimum level. These agreements also
mandate that pending an ultimate solution to the boundary question, the two sides shall strictly respect
and observe the Line of Actual Control. Furthermore in these agreements, India and China also
committed to clarification and confirmation of the Line of Actual Control to reach a common
understanding of the alignment. Thus, in late 1990s and upto 2003, the two sides engaged in an exercise
to clarify and confirm the LAC. But, thereafter the Chinese side did not show a willingness to pursue
the LAC clarification exercise. As a result, there are some areas where the Chinese and Indian
perceptions of LAC overlap. In these areas, as also with other sections of the border areas, the various
agreements govern the manner in which troops of both sides should operate and deal with situations
of face-offs to maintain peace and tranquility.
The last one decade has been a decade of minor military confrontation between India and China,
whether it was the Depsang incident in 2013, or Chumar incident in 2014, stand-off in Doklam in 2017.
The confrontation were largely resolved at the ground level without any fatalities on either sides, till
the incident at the Galwan happened in 2020.
The Galwan Crisis
Since April 2020, India had noticed a buildup of troops and armaments by the Chinese side in the
border areas adjacent to Eastern Ladakh. In early May, the Chinese side had taken action to hinder the
normal, traditional patrolling pattern of our troops in the Galwan Valley area, which resulted in a face-
off. Even as this situation was being addressed by the Ground Commanders as per the provisions of
our bilateral agreements and protocol, in mid-May the Chinese side made several attempts to transgress
the LAC in other parts of the Western Sector. This included Kongka La, Gogra and North Bank of
Pangong Lake. These attempts were detected early and consequently responded to appropriately by
our armed forces.8
8 Text of Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh’s Statement in Lok Sabha on September 15 Regarding Situation on Eastern
Border in Ladakh, Ministry of Defence, Press Information Bureau, 15 September 2020India made it clear to the Chinese side both through diplomatic and military channels that China was,
by such actions, attempting to unilaterally alter the status quo. It was categorically conveyed that this
was unacceptable.
Given the growing friction along the LAC, the Senior Commanders of the two sides in a meeting on
June 06, 2020 agreed on a process of disengagement that involved reciprocal actions. Both sides also
agreed to respect and abide by the LAC and not undertake any activity to alter the status quo. However
in violation of this the Chinese side created a violent face off on June 15 June 2020 at Galwan.
Colonel Bikumalla Santosh Babu, Commanding Officer, 16 BIHAR, was deployed in Galwan Valley
(Eastern Ladakh) during Operation Snow Leopard. Operation Snow Leopard was launched after China
refused to move back and restore status quo ante in eastern Ladakh. He was tasked to establish an
Observation Post in face of the enemy. Organising and briefing his troops about the situation with a
sound plan, he successfully executed the task. While holding the position his column faced stiff
resistance from the adversary who attacked using lethal and sharp weapons along with heavy stone
pelting from adjoining heights. Undaunted by the violent and aggressive action by overwhelming
strength of enemy soldiers, the officer in true spirit of service before self, continued to resist the
enemy’s attempt to pushback Indian troops. Despite being grievously injured, Colonel Bikumalla
Santosh Babu led from the front with absolute command and control despite hostile conditions to deter
the vicious enemy attack at his position. In the skirmish that broke out and ensuing hand to hand
combat with enemy soldiers, he valiantly resisted the enemy attack till his last breath, inspiring and
motivating his troops to hold ground. India brave soldiers laid down their lives and also inflicted costs
including casualties on the Chinese side. Colonel B. Santhosh Babu was posthumously awarded Maha
Vir Chakra (MVC), the country's second highest war time gallantry award, by President Ram Nath
Kovind.

to clarify and confirm the LAC. But, thereafter the Chinese side did not show a willingness to pursue
the LAC clarification exercise. As a result, there are some areas where the Chinese and Indian
perceptions of LAC overlap. In these areas, as also with other sections of the border areas, the various
agreements govern the manner in which troops of both sides should operate and deal with situations
of face-offs to maintain peace and tranquility.
The last one decade has been a decade of minor military confrontation between India and China,
whether it was the Depsang incident in 2013, or Chumar incident in 2014, stand-off in Doklam in 2017.
The confrontation were largely resolved at the ground level without any fatalities on either sides, till
the incident at the Galwan happened in 2020.
The Galwan Crisis
Since April 2020, India had noticed a buildup of troops and armaments by the Chinese side in the
border areas adjacent to Eastern Ladakh. In early May, the Chinese side had taken action to hinder the
normal, traditional patrolling pattern of our troops in the Galwan Valley area, which resulted in a face-
off. Even as this situation was being addressed by the Ground Commanders as per the provisions of
our bilateral agreements and protocol, in mid-May the Chinese side made several attempts to transgress
the LAC in other parts of the Western Sector. This included Kongka La, Gogra and North Bank of
Pangong Lake. These attempts were detected early and consequently responded to appropriately by
our armed forces.8
8 Text of Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh’s Statement in Lok Sabha on September 15 Regarding Situation on Eastern
Border in Ladakh, Ministry of Defence, Press Information Bureau, 15 September 2020India made it clear to the Chinese side both through diplomatic and military channels that China was,
by such actions, attempting to unilaterally alter the status quo. It was categorically conveyed that this
was unacceptable.
Given the growing friction along the LAC, the Senior Commanders of the two sides in a meeting on
June 06, 2020 agreed on a process of disengagement that involved reciprocal actions. Both sides also
agreed to respect and abide by the LAC and not undertake any activity to alter the status quo. However
in violation of this the Chinese side created a violent face off on June 15 June 2020 at Galwan.
Colonel Bikumalla Santosh Babu, Commanding Officer, 16 BIHAR, was deployed in Galwan Valley
(Eastern Ladakh) during Operation Snow Leopard. Operation Snow Leopard was launched after China
refused to move back and restore status quo ante in eastern Ladakh. He was tasked to establish an
Observation Post in face of the enemy. Organising and briefing his troops about the situation with a
sound plan, he successfully executed the task. While holding the position his column faced stiff
resistance from the adversary who attacked using lethal and sharp weapons along with heavy stone
pelting from adjoining heights. Undaunted by the violent and aggressive action by overwhelming
strength of enemy soldiers, the officer in true spirit of service before self, continued to resist the
enemy’s attempt to pushback Indian troops. Despite being grievously injured, Colonel Bikumalla
Santosh Babu led from the front with absolute command and control despite hostile conditions to deter
the vicious enemy attack at his position. In the skirmish that broke out and ensuing hand to hand
combat with enemy soldiers, he valiantly resisted the enemy attack till his last breath, inspiring and
motivating his troops to hold ground. India brave soldiers laid down their lives and also inflicted costs
including casualties on the Chinese side. Colonel B. Santhosh Babu was posthumously awarded Maha
Vir Chakra (MVC), the country's second highest war time gallantry award, by President Ram Nath
Kovind.

India China Border Issue
India and China have longstanding border issue, and are yet to resolve their boundary problem.
China does not accept the customary and traditional alignment of the boundary between India
and China. India, on the other hand believe that this alignment is based on well-established
geographical principles confirmed by treaties and agreements, as well as historical usage and
practice, well-known for centuries to both sides. The Chinese position, however, is that the
boundary between the two countries has not been formally delimited, that there exists a
traditional customary line formed by the extent of jurisdiction that they claim was exercised
historically by each side, and that the two sides have different interpretations of the position of
the traditional customary line. The two countries had engaged in discussions during 1950s-60s
but these efforts could not yield a mutually acceptable solution.1
China invaded Tibet and annexed it in March 1959. Growing concern over Chinese aggression
forced India to relook at its border policy, as China became India’s neighbour. India enacted
the ""Forward Policy"" in 1960, which was aimed to prevent Chinese incursions into Indian
territory by establishing Indian stations near the Sino-Indian boundary.2 In reaction to the
Forward Policy, China started gradually enhancing her road infrastructure leading to the border
and strengthening her military positions along the border. 3 The Chinese quickened the forward
movement of their posts, and soon the empty area between the two armies disappeared. When
some Indian posts, for example in the Galwan Valley were established, the Chinese attitude
changed and became more threatening. Instead of going back they encountered Indian posts,
surrounding the post to cut off its land route of supply, and even opened fire at a number of
places.
On 30 April 1962, the Chinese government threatened to impose an extension of the patrolling
along the entire boundary. Chinese forces surrounded an Indian position in the Galwan Valley
in July 1962. The two sides clashed at Pangong Lake. They also continued to set up a number
of new aggressive military posts in the Ladakh region. China stepped up its aggressive military
actions along the Indian border in the early months of 1962. On 08 September 1962, Chinese
forces breached the border in the Northwest corner of NEFA. On October 20, 1962, they
launched a massive attack on Indian territory in both the Eastern and Western Sectors following
a series of probing operations.4

Following the 1965 war with Pakistan, China initiated disturbances along the Tibet-Sikkim

September 1967. The skirmish escalated to artillery guns and threats of fighter jets. Similarly,
at Tulung La in 1975, an Assam Rifles patrol was fired upon killing four soldiers of the 5
Assam Rifles Battalion.
India used to occupy a seasonal post at Wangdong near Sumdrong Chu from 1984. When they
withdrew from the post for the winter of 1985, it was populated by the Chinese forces. On 16
June 1986, a patrol of 12 ASSAM Regiment of the Indian Army noticed Chinese presence in
the area and construction of a few permanent structures. The Chinese soldiers were initially
identified to be 40 and were soon reinforced by 200 more troops. By August, they had
constructed a helipad and were being air supplied.5 After rounds of diplomatic parleys and talks
between military commanders, the two sides agreed to vacate two posts. 6
Both India and China have formally agreed that the boundary question is a complex issue which

Naib Subedar Nuduram Soren was part of Operation Snow Leopard, in Galwan Valley (Eastern
Ladakh). Operation Snow Leopard was launched after China refused to move back and restore
status quo ante in eastern Ladakh. On 15 June 2020 he was leading column during a skirmish
with the enemy. He valiantly led his column and resisted the enemy’s attempt to push back the
Indian soldiers establishing an Observation Post. He organised his column, countered the
adversary forcefully and stopped them in their attempt to push back Indian troops. He
motivated his troops to hold ground at all costs and prevented the enemy from pushing back
Indian troops.
His ability to lead from the front stood out in the skirmish to such an extent that he was
perceived as a threat by the enemy. Accordingly he was targeted with lethal weapons and stones
from the adjoining heights. As a result of this onslaught he was grievously injured, when asked
to move back, as a true leader he refused, inspite of being heavily outnumbered by the enemy
soldiers. The Junior Leader stood at the forefront under hostile conditions and displayed raw
courage, fighting with resolute spirit in a hand to hand combat, before succumbing to his
injuries.
The gallant action by the Junior Commissioned Officer resulted in a positive response which
overwhelmed the enemy by surprise. His action speeded own retaliation and also galvanised
own troops to continue to hold ground. He continued to hold his ground with resolute and
indefatigable spirit before achieving martyrdom. This supreme sacrifice motivated own troops
to rally together and resist thus stalling the enemy's aggression. For displaying of conspicuous
gallantry in the face of enemy, determined courage and for supreme sacrifice in the line of duty,

along the LAC in the border areas is bound to have implications on the positive direction of ties.
A key element of both the 1993 and the 1996 Agreements is that the two sides will keep their
military forces in the areas along the Line of Actual Control to a minimum level. These agreementsalso mandate that pending an ultimate solution to the boundary question, the two sides shall strictly
respect and observe the Line of Actual Control. Furthermore in these agreements, India and China
also committed to clarification and confirmation of the Line of Actual Control to reach a common
understanding of the alignment. Thus, in late 1990s and upto 2003, the two sides engaged in an
exercise to clarify and confirm the LAC. But, thereafter the Chinese side did not show a willingness
to pursue the LAC clarification exercise. As a result, there are some areas where the Chinese and
Indian perceptions of LAC overlap. In these areas, as also with other sections of the border areas, the
various agreements govern the manner in which troops of both sides should operate and deal with
situations of face-offs to maintain peace and tranquility.
The last one decade has been a decade of minor military confrontation between India and China,
whether it was the Depsang incident in 2013, or Chumar incident in 2014, stand-off in Doklam in
2017. The confrontation were largely resolved at the ground level without any fatalities on either
sides, till the incident at the Galwan happened in 2020.
Since April 2020, India had noticed a buildup of troops and armaments by the Chinese side in the
border areas adjacent to Eastern Ladakh. In early May, the Chinese side had taken action to hinder
the normal, traditional patrolling pattern of our troops in the Galwan Valley area, which resulted in a
face- off. Even as this situation was being addressed by the Ground Commanders as per the
provisions of our bilateral agreements and protocol, in mid-May the Chinese side made several
attempts to transgress the LAC in other parts of the Western Sector. This included Kongka La, Gogra
and North Bank of Pangong Lake. These attempts were detected early and consequently responded
to appropriately by our armed forces.
India made it clear to the Chinese side both through diplomatic and military channels that China was,
by such actions, attempting to unilaterally alter the status quo. It was categorically conveyed that this
was unacceptable.
Given the growing friction along the LAC, the Senior Commanders of the two sides in a meeting on
June 06, 2020 agreed on a process of disengagement that involved reciprocal actions. Both sides also
agreed to respect and abide by the LAC and not undertake any activity to alter the status quo.
However in violation of this the Chinese side created a violent face off on June 15 June 2020 at
Galwan.
On night of 15 June 2020, Havildar K Palani was part of joint patrol of 16 BIHAR near Line of
Actual Control, which was stopped and challenged by enemy soldiers. This resulted in heated
arguments and ensued closed fist fight. He fought valiantly and resisted the enemy soldiers.
Suddenly when enemy soldiers outnumbered and encircled him, he stood bravely to defend his
comrades. Inspite of his grievous injuries, he continued to hold his ground resolutely and in the finest
traditions of the Indian Army, laid down his life for the motherland.Havildar K Palani with Fellow Soldiers

The Bihar Regiment traces its history back to the 34th Sepoy Battalion formed during the tenure of
Lord Robert Clive in 1758, which was raised entirely from Bhojpur district. It was during the Second
World War that soldiers from Bihar were once again recruited in the 19th Hyderabad Regiment. 1
BIHAR Regiment, which was raised on 15 September 1941, owes its origin to the 11/19 Hyderabad
Regiment.
Most of the battalions of the Regiment participated in the Indo-Pak Wars of 1965 and 1971 and
accomplished their assigned tasks in a commendable manner. 10 BIHAR was awarded the Theatre
Honour of `AKHAURA' for its gallant action in the Battle of Akhaura in East Pakistan in 1971. 1
BIHAR participated in ‘OPERATION VIJAY’ in the Batalik Sub Sector and was responsible for
recapture of Jubar Hill and Tharu. For its valour, the unit was honoured with Chief of the Army StaffUnit",", Battle Honour ‘BATALIK’ and Theatre Honour ‘KARGIL’.1
India China Border Dispute
India and China have longstanding border issue, and are yet to resolve their boundary problem. China
does not accept the customary and traditional alignment of the boundary between India and China.
India, on the other hand believe that this alignment is based on well-established geographical principles
confirmed by treaties and agreements, as well as historical usage and practice, well-known for
centuries to both sides. The Chinese position, however, is that the boundary between the two countries
has not been formally delimited, that there exists a traditional customary line formed by the extent of
jurisdiction that they claim was exercised historically by each side, and that the two sides have different
interpretations of the position of the traditional customary line. The two countries had engaged in
discussions during 1950s-60s but these efforts could not yield a mutually acceptable solution.2
China invaded Tibet and annexed it in March 1959. Growing concern over Chinese aggression forced
India to relook at its border policy, as China became India’s neighbour. India enacted the ""Forward
Policy"" in 1960, which was aimed to prevent Chinese incursions into Indian territory by establishing
Indian stations near the Sino-Indian boundary.3 In reaction to the Forward Policy, China started
gradually enhancing her road infrastructure leading to the border and strengthening her military
positions along the border. 4 The Chinese quickened the forward movement of their posts, and soon
the empty area between the two armies disappeared. When some Indian posts, for example in the
Galwan Valley were established, the Chinese attitude changed and became more threatening. Instead
of going back they encountered Indian posts, surrounding the post to cut off its land route of supply,
and even opened fire at a number of places.
On 30 April 1962, the Chinese government threatened to impose an extension of the patrolling along
the entire boundary. Chinese forces surrounded an Indian position in the Galwan Valley in July 1962.
The two sides clashed at Pangong Lake. They also continued to set up a number of new aggressive
military posts in the Ladakh region. China stepped up its aggressive military actions along the Indian
border in the early months of 1962. On 08 September 1962, Chinese forces breached the border in the
Northwest corner of NEFA. On October 20, 1962, they launched a massive attack on Indian territory
in both the Eastern and Western Sectors following a series of probing operations.5
The first India-China War broke out putting an end to any chance of resolving the conflict in line with
accepted international norms.
Following the 1965 war with Pakistan, China initiated disturbances along the Tibet-Sikkim border,
particularly at Nathu-la Pass. In 1967, India China clash took place due to disagreement over the laying

escalated to artillery guns and threats of fighter jets. Similarly, at Tulung La in 1975, an Assam Rifles
patrol was fired upon killing four soldiers of the 5 Assam Rifles Battalion.
India used to occupy a seasonal post at Wangdong near Sumdrong Chu from 1984. When they
withdrew from the post for the winter of 1985, it was populated by the Chinese forces. On 16 June
1986, a patrol of 12 ASSAM Regiment of the Indian Army noticed Chinese presence in the area and
construction of a few permanent structures. The Chinese soldiers were initially identified to be 40 and
were soon reinforced by 200 more troops. By August, they had constructed a helipad and were being
air supplied.6 After rounds of diplomatic parleys and talks between military commanders, the two sides
agreed to vacate two posts. 7
Both India and China have formally agreed that the boundary question is a complex issue which
requires patience and have committed to seeking a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution
through dialogue and peaceful negotiations. In the interim, the two sides also agreed that maintenance
of peace and tranquility in the border areas is an essential basis for the further development of bilateral
relations.
China continues to be in illegal occupation of approximately 38,000 sq. kms in the Union Territory of
Ladakh. In addition, under the so-called Sino-Pakistan 'Boundary Agreement' of 1963, Pakistan
illegally ceded 5,180 sq. kms. of Indian territory in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir to China. China also
claims approximately 90,000 sq. kms. of Indian territory in the Eastern Sector of the India-China
boundary in Arunachal Pradesh.
There is no commonly delineated Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the border areas between India and
China and there is no common perception of the entire LAC. Therefore, in order to ensure peace and
tranquility in the border areas, especially along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the two countries
have concluded a number of agreements and protocols.
Under these agreements, the two sides have agreed to maintain peace and tranquility along the LAC
without any effect to their respective positions on the alignment of the LAC as well as on the boundary
question. It is on this basis, that overall relations also saw considerable progress since 1988. India’s

,,,,"1950. The UNC signifies the world’s first attempt at collective security under the United
Nations system. United Nations Security Council Resolutions 83 and 84 provided the
international legal authority for member states to restore peace on the Korean Peninsula, and
they designated the US as the leader of the unified command termed as UNC. This was the first
time the UN deployed armed troops to get control of the situation. The Korean crisis gave birth
to the UN Peacekeeping forces in which troops from countries like India, the US, Great Britain,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa were deployed to maintain a ceasefire and
pave way for negotiations.
After three years of violent confrontations and countless attempts to negotiate justice for both
these countries, on 27th July 1953, the war came to an end. An Armistice agreement was signed
between both countries which stated that Korea will remain a divided country. The agreement
also ordered for creation of a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) and the
Custodian Force India (CFI) for supervision of Armistice and the disposal of prisoners of war.

The CFI was made up of 5 RAJ RIF, 6 JAT, 3 DOGRA, and 3 GARH RIF along with ancillary
services grouped under the 190 Infantry Brigade. Maj Gen S.P.P. Thorat, DSO, was nominated
as the General Officer Commanding (GOC). Subsequently, there was an accretion of one more
battalion to the brigade. In all 5,230 Indian troops were deployed in Korea. The forces left
India in five batches in August-September of 1953 1. On the arrival in Korea, the CFI took over
approx. 25,000 prisoners under protection.

estimated 50 million civilians and soldiers d lost their lives in Korea. Many feared that this war
might turn into a full-fledged confrontation between the superpowers and lead to World War

Tundup Dorje he joined the Army after completing his school education. He was recruited into the
Ladakhi Battalion of 14 J&K Militia on 28 July 1959. By the year 1962, Sepoy Sonam Angchok
had been serving in the Indian Army for approximately three years. During the Sino- India war of
1962, Sepoy Sonam Angchok 14 J&K Militia was deployed in Ladakh along the China border.
The Ladakh Scouts known as the “Snow Warriors” were initially raised as a Paramilitary Force
formed of Ladakhi locals known as Nubra Guards to save Ladakh from intruders in 1948. It
comprised of Ladakhi locals who are physically fit and attuned with the rugged terrain and hostile
climate. The Ladakh Scouts was raised in 1963, following the Indo China War of 1962. It had two
Wings- the Karakoram Wing, defending the Eastern front facing China and the Indus Wing facing
Pakistan. The Regiment currently consists of five battalions. The Ladakh Scouts had fought in the
1965 and 1971 India Pakistan War and were also part of Operation Meghdoot in 1984. Ladakh
Scouts was converted into a Regiment in the year 2000. The Ladakh Scouts played a significant
role during the Kargil War of 1999 by marking one of the earliest victories and also received the
Unit","from General VP Malik, the then Chief of Army Staff.1
Since its independence, India followed a foreign policy of maintaining cordial relations with
China. It wanted to revive its ancient contacts with the people of China since both the countries
shared political, geographical and cultural similarities. Therefore, soon after its establishment on
01 October 1949, India was one of the first few countries to grant diplomatic status to the People’s
Republic of China (PRC). India supported the demand of state recognition of PRC on various
international platforms. India took the initiative to enter into negotiations with China on the
question of Tibet and entered into the Panchsheel Agreement in 1954. Within a few weeks of Chou
Enlai’s visit to India, the Chinese launched a protest against the presence of Indian troops in
Barahoti, three kilometers South of a border pass, Tun Jun La in Uttar Pradesh. This was the first
time, the Government of China laid claim to any part of Indian territory formally. The construction
of the Tibet-Sinkiang Road in 1957, marked a turning point in the Sino-India relations as the
Chinese occupied a large part of the Aksai Plateau. This opened an opportunity for China to come
out with territorial claims against India openly. By 1959, Chinese soldiers moved in further into
Ladakh and established themselves at Chushul- Rezang La, and at Mandal, just South of Dambu
Guru. On 08 September 1962, about 600 Chinese troops encircled the Dhola Post in the Eastern
sector and began firing. The Chinese launched simultaneous attacks in NEFA in Namku Chu
Sector as well as in Ladakh. The overwhelming number of the Chinese troops hit the Indian

During the Sino-India War of 1962, Sepoy Sonam Angchok was deployed in Daulat Beg Oldi
(DBO) Sub-Sector of Northern Ladakh. DBO was a vitally important post since four tracks
radiated from it. The old Silk Route went north, crossed the Karakoram Pass (5575 meters) and
went on to Yarkand in Sinkiang. The other two routes connected DBO to Leh, over 200 kilometres
away, and requiring at least twelve days of long and difficult marching to reach it. Th Eastern or
Winter route went due south from DB0 crossing the Track Junction, Chip Chap River and the
Depsang Plains to reach the Murgo Post. 14 J&K Militia (now LADHAK SCOUTS) was

Government of India.responsible to defend the DBO area and a Company of 5 JAT was deployed alongside. On October
17, 1962 reports of heavy Chinese concentration opposite our Post Chandani started coming in.
This concentration of Chinese was so heavy that it posed a threat to entire area of Chip Chap and
Kara Koram.

DBO itself had the Battalion Headquarters and nearly a Company strength. The rest of the available
force was distributed on two possible approached. Chip Chap River valley had a total of ten Posts.
Chip Chap Posts 1 to 4 were located North of the river Chip Chap, while Posts 5 to 10 were to the
south. Posts 10 to 14 guarded the approach from an uncharted river valley further south. Inaddition, there were some troops in Murgo, Sultan Chushku, Track Junction, and all the way down
to Shyok village, to provide staging posts for supply as well as the columns that regularly moved
between the main base at Leh and DBO. Out of these twenty-one Posts, DBO had a Company
strength and also Posts 1 and 4 on the North of Chip Chap River had a Platoon each (roughly 25
to 30 men). Posts 5, 7 and 14 also had Platoon each. Rest of the Posts had Section strength (between
10 to 15). These Posts were dependent upon DBO for their supply. All the Posts were equipped
only with small arms with the exception of Post 1 that had a Section of 3-inch mortars. The Posts
thus were not in a position to dominate more than 500 meters distance around them, this being the
effective range of the Light Machine Guns. average distance between the Posts was 2 to 3 kms and
some like Post 14 were nearly 10 to 12 kms away from nearest Indian Posts. There was thus no
possibility of mutual support.
The Chinese had been building up their strength In the Sector from July 1962 onwards. The vicinity
of Indian Post No 4 enabled them to bring in their heavy weapons very close to our posts. On 19
October 1962, all the Indian Posts near Chip Chap were dominated by the Chinese in superior
strength.

Around 0230 hours on 20 October, the Chinese brought pressure against Posts 2 and 3 manned by,
5 JAT located on the Northern bank of Chip Chap River and the personnel of these two Posts were
asked to fall back on Post 4. Post 1 (Chandani) manned by a Platoon of 14 J&K Militia, was nowisolated. This Post was well sited on high ground and was not easy to assault. On 20 October at
0600 hours Chinese commenced shelling Post 1. The bombardment continued for nearly one hour.
After this the post was attacked by the Chinese, the Commander at DBO attempted to send
reinforcements to it, but the Chinese, who had by then occupied Post 5, which effectively
dominated the route, made it impossible.
On 20 October 1962, when our Post 1 (Chandni) in Ladakh was attacked by the Chinese, Sepoy
Sonam Angchok fought with great courage and determination. Even though severely wounded, he
stuck to his post until he was overpowered and killed by the enemy. His valour in the face ofthe
enemy was in the highest traditions of our Army.
In the battles of Daulat Beg Oldi Sub Sector, Indian troops fought valiantly despite having scarcity
of resources and being outnumbered by the Chinese troops. In the fight of Post 1 (Chandani) or
Post 4, Subedar Sonam Stopdan and Havildar Saroop Singh of the 14 J&K Militia made the
supreme sacrifice after taking heavy toll of the enemy. Both were honored with the nation's second
highest gallantry award, the Maha Vir Chakra. Major Sardul Singh Randhawa was decorated with
the MVC for his inspiring leadership, courage, commitment, steadfastness and the manner in
which he organized the retreat in the DBO Sub-Sector.CITATION

night when Chinese commenced their attacks against the Isolated 'Forward Policy’ Posts. This
Phase lasted till 27 October between this time and 18 November there was lull in fighting . This
period was utilized by both sides to build up their strengths, while Chinese build up was mainly
opposite Spangur Gap, the Indian side strengthened defences in the depth. In third and final Phase
the Chinese overwhelmed the Indian defences on the Eastern edge of Chushul airfield. The cease
fire was declared on of 21 November 1962, by when the Chinese had rendered the airfield unusable
for Indians.

After being relieved by 5 JAT in second week of October 1962, a Company less Platoon strength
was deployed in Sirijap Compex North of Pangong lake. This Post was supplied by boats across
the lake and had no land link with the Battalion. South of Pangong Lake was the Yula Complex
consisting of three Posts manned by another Company 1/8 GORKHA RIFLES. Nearly two
Companies defended the Spangur Gap. Both the hills on the Northern Shoulder named Gurung
Hill and to the South Magar Hill, were held. In addition, there was a Post in the Gap itself.

On 18 November the Chinese attack in this Sector started, coinciding with their attack on Sela in
NEFA. The Chinese were obviously working to a timetable. Chushul with its airfield and the
Indian brigade was a thorn in the Chinese flesh as that provided a possible jump off point for an
Indian threat to the Chinese occupied Aksai Chin and the highway running through it. In fact a
cursory thought was given by the CGS to the possibility of offensive across Spangur Gap in order
to relieve pressure in the Chip Chap valley. The idea did not progress any further, as the Indians
did not have adequate strength for it.
The Chinese launched a two-pronged attack on Chushul defences. northern prong of attack and
nearly regiment strength, attacked Gurung hill. Basically, the Chinese, lower half of Black Top
Hill was under Chinese. The Chinese thus had the advantage of attacking down-hill, which always
is a major consideration in mountains. The attack on Gurung Hill posed a direct threat to Chushul
airfield.The going for the invading Chinese was tougher at Gurung Hill. The Chinese attacked Gurung Hill
complex simultaneously with their attacked Rezangla. the approach chosen was from Black Hill,
that gave them an advantage of attacking from the ground. At 0530 Hours on 18 November, the
Chinese began intense bombardment of Gurung Hill as well as the Indian posts located in the
Spangur Gap and Mugga Hill.

(Source: https://www.indiasentinels.com)
Two companies of 1/8 Gorkha Rifles were defending the vast area of Gurung Hill. The troops had
well dug positions protected by wire and some Anti- personnel mines. and the attack was expected
from the direction of Black Hill; the defenses were therefore ready to face the Chinese. The first
wave of attackers made contact with the northern company of the Gurung hill at 0630 Hours. Here
the Chinese were in a surprise. When still outside the small arms range, they engaged the Chinese
troops by accurate fire from the guns of 13 FIELD REGIMENT. Second Lieutenant S.D.Goswami,
the Artillery Observation Officer, did a commendable of directing the fire. When Second
Lieutenant S.D Goswami was wounded, Technical Assistant Gurdip Singh, though severely
wounded himself, took over command of the Post and continued to directed the fire of our Artillery
on the enemy thereby inflicting heavy casualties on them. In this action Technical Assistant GurdipSingh displayed great initiative and courage of a high order and was awarded Vir Chakra
Posthumously.
Hundreds of Chinese infantry soldiers started moving forward from Black Top in the direction of
Table Top. Artillery operator Second Lietenant Goswami, who had been sent to relieve Captain A
D Singh for a couple of days, got involved in the fighting and was given a higher level of
responsibility as the Gorkhas waited for the enemy to come within fire range. He continued to
provide the Chinese with precise fire. Since many of the Chinese troops were killed by Indian
artillery fire, this effectively stopped the Chinese from advancing. With their single-shot weapons,
the Gorkhas started firing at the enemy right away, blocking at least two enemy attacks from the
Black Top. However, the front section of the platoon was soon overrun.
The post's commander, Captain Purshottam Lal Kher, continued to go from post to post despite
enemy firing until he sustained serious injuries. Jemedar Tej Bahadur Gurung assumed command
when Captain Kher was hurt and carried on fighting and driving back the attackers. Additionally,
he moved from post to post, fending off the enemy's waves of attacks. He got his men out from
the trenches, and using, traditional Gorkha Khukri (a small curved knife) on the Chinese. The
Chinese had to fall back fearing this fierce onslaught. For several hours, the enemy suffered heavy
losses in the intense conflict. While switching positions, a burst of fire injured Jemedar Tej
Bahadur in the chest; however, he refused to be taken to safety and died fighting. The Gorkhas
were then told to leave by Captain Kher since they were outnumbered.
The brave Gorkhas were finally overwhelmed by vastly superior numbers, and the forward Platoon
fell. Out of 17 men in this Platoon the every single one died fighting the Chinese. The Chinese
launched a series of attacks and finally, after two hours, a detachment managed to occupy some
portions of Gurung Hill. By 1000 hours the situation stabilized and Gurung Hill remained firmly
in Indian hands. In the meanwhile, Chinese were continuously shelling the Spangur Gap as well
as airfield. The track between Gurung Hill and the Battalion Headquarters was no longer usable.
The men on Gun Hill were asked to conserve their ammunition for second attack by the Chinese,
which was expected soon. The second attack was preceded by even intense shelling.","(JC-17616) JEMEDAR TEJ BAHADUR SINGH GURUNG

On 18 November 1962, the Chinese started shelling our post at Gurung Hill with heavy mortar and
artillery guns. Jemadar Tej Bahadur Gurung kept the troops of his platoon alert in their positions,
and when the enemy attacked in successive waves he went from post to post, repulsing each enemy
attack. The furious fight continued for about four hours during which heavy casualties were
inflicted on the enemy. When the officer-in-charge of the post and the forward observation officer
of artillery became casualties, Jemadar Gurung took over the command and kept on fighting and
repulsing the enemy. While on his round from one post to another, he was wounded in the chest
by burst officer but continued fighting and refused to be evacuated till he succumbed to his
injuries. Jemadar Gurung displayed outstanding courage and leadership of a high order.

Dehradun, Uttarakhand. He studied at New Forest Higher Secondary School, Dehradun. He
was commissioned into the 3 JAT on 30 June 1963. Captain Kapil Singh Thapa was awarded
the Maha Vir Chakra on 21 September 1965.
The JAT Regiment is one of the oldest regiments of the Indian Army. It is an Infantry Regiment
that claims its origins to the Calcutta Native Militia raised in 1795, which later became an
Infantry Battalion of the Bengal Army. Jat people were historically considered to be martial
class and were enlisted in the British Army when the policy on class Regiments came. In 1922,
during the grouping of the class Regiment the 9 Jat Regiment was formed by bringing under a
single Regiment, four active Battalions and one Training Battalion. In the post-independent
era, the JAT Regiment had lived up to their reputation and holds the distinction of fighting in
all the wars that India fought since its independence including the IPKF to Sri Lanka. Their
battle cry: Jat Balwan, Jai Bhagwan was adopted in 1955. 17 JAT received “Unit","”
from the Chief of the Army Staff, General VP Malik for their conspicuous courage in the Kargil
War.
The genesis of the Indo-Pak conflict can be traced back to the year 1947. The bone of
contention between India and Pakistan are the attempts by Pakistan to annex the erstwhile state
of Jammu and Kashmir by any means. The ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir and our
frontiers with Pakistan have remained a sensitive zone for years. Pakistan has on and off
resorted to firing, incursions and intrusions at several points of these frontiers, compelling India
to adopt defensive measures. These attempts of Pakistan have been met by the Indian Armed
Forces with commendable bravery and steely resilience, but always with great restraint to not
escalate the conflict. The Indo-Pak War of 1965 was the second war fought between these two
bordering countries. While India was still recovering from the Sino-India War of 1962,
Pakistan saw it as an opportunity to acquire Jammu and Kashmir with might, presuming India
to be weak in terms of defence preparation. The war began on 24 April 1965, when the Pakistan
Army attacked Indian territory in the Rann of Kutch and penetrated six to eight miles inside
the Indian territory. This act of illegal occupation of Indian territory constituted violation of
the Indo-Pak Border Agreement ,1960 and the international law as per the United Nations
Charter. The Pakistani forces subsequently intruded in Kashmir with the launch of Operation
Gibraltar.
3 JAT, backed by divisional artillery, planned a significant flanking manouvre covering 6000
yards to seize Dograi in the Lahore Sector from the North. On 21 September, 3 JAT carried out
extensive patrolling to gather intelligence on Dograi, which was to be attacked in the night. It
was discovered that the Pakistanis were well entrenched. There were minefield and wire
entanglements. The town itself was guarded by reinforced concrete pill-boxes around its three
approaches.3 JAT at Dograi

On 02 June 1956, Second Lieutenant Raman’s Battalion received information from intelligence
sources about the presence of Naga militants in Chephema village in Nagaland. After assessing
the situation, it was decided to launch an operation to apprehend the militants at the earliest.
Consequently, an Assault Team led by Second Lieutenant Raman swung into action in the early
morning of 03 June 1956. As per the plan. Second Lieutenant Raman and his troops reached
the suspected hideout area at around 0500 Hours in the morning. Soon the troops spotted the
militants, who opened fire at them on being challenged. The militants were heavily armed and
were using Light Machine Guns, Sten guns, and rifles. As it was foggy and dark, it was very
difficult to ascertain the positions of the militants.
But suddenly Second Lieutenant Raman spotted the movement in a nearby hut and rushed
towards it. He then in swift and courageous action fired and killed two militants. In the
meantime, one of the militants threw a hand grenade at him, which fortunately did not harm
him as he was able to escape in the nick of the time.

INFANTRY (POSTHUMOUS)
(Effective date of the award-24 April 1956)
On June 3, 'A' Company of the Battalion was ordered to attack Chephema village in Kohima,
at dawn, to clear a hostile stronghold. As the Company reached Chephema at 0500 hours, it
encountered heavy hostile fire from the village. At this juncture Second Lieutenant Raman,
who was commanding No. 2 Platoon of the Company, was asked to clear the village of the
hostiles. But as he entered the village, intense fire was directed at him from light machine guns,
sten guns, and rifles. Owing to mist and low visibility he was unable to determine the exact
location of the hostile position, while the bullets from the hostiles made any advance
impossible.
Suddenly, there was a break in the thick mist. Second Lieutenant Raman could now see some
hostile movement in the vicinity of a hut. Seizing the opportunity he rushed towards the hut,
and in the first burst of his sten gun, killed two hostiles. A third hostile, who was hiding nearby
hurled a grenade which narrowly missed him. Second Lieutenant Raman kept on advancing
and with another burst of his sten gun he killed one more hostile. Here a hostile threw another
grenade at him, which teared through his hat and injured him. But he pursued the assault
relentlessly. This demoralised the hostiles completely and they took to their heels. The gallant
officer continued to press on and killed one more hostile. The position was thus cleared.
Meanwhile, a hostile fired a burst from his sten gun, from point blank range wounding Second
Lieutenant Raman in the groin. But he did not give up and hurled a grenade at the attacker. The
injured hostile was seen dragging himself on to a nearby bush. The mist now started lifting.
Second Lieutenant Raman shouted for his men to push forward and dislodge the remaining
hostiles. Inspired by him the men cleared the village. In this action the hostiles suffered five
killed and three wounded, and lost one SBML gun and some ammunition. In clearing this well
prepared hostile position he made the supreme sacrifice. In this action Second Lieutenant Polur
Muthuswamy Raman displayed exceptional leadership and devotion to duty and was awarded
Ashoka Chakra, posthumously.
